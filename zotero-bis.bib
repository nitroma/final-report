A spiral coil made out of wire gauge was inserted inside the fixed bed of catalyst. The gas preferentially passed through the void spaces created due to the presence of the coil. Hydrodynamic studies were conducted using water as liquid and air as gas. The effect of various parameters such as the configuration of the spiral coil, flow rate of gas and liquid on the pressure drop and liquid hold up of the catalyst bed were studied and were also compared with that of a conventional trickle bed reactor.},

	abstract = {The simplest member of the aromatic carboxylic acid family, benzoic acid was first described in the 17th century and initially used extensively as a medicinal substance. Currently the main uses for benzoic acid are as a chemical additive in alkyd resins and as a raw material in the manufacture of phenol, caprolactam, glycol dibenzoate plasticizer esters, and in the production of the food preservatives, sodium and potassium benzoates. The liquid phase air oxidation of toluene provides most of the world's supply of benzoic acid. Large quantities of benzaldehyde can be recovered in the same process. Other major derivatives of benzoic acid include benzoyl chloride, benzoic anhydride, and a number of benzyl esters, used in fragrances and personal care products. These include methyl, ethyl, butyl and hexyl benzoate as well as alkyl (C12-15) benzoate.},

	abstract = {Amines are derivatives of ammonia in which one or more of the hydrogens is replaced with an alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, or heterocyclic group. When more than one hydrogen has been replaced, the substituents can either be the same or different. Amines are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary depending on the number of hydrogens that have been replaced. Many different types of nitrogen-containing compounds can be reduced to amines. In practice, however, nitriles or nitro compounds are usually used because they are the most easily obtained starting materials. There are several commercial processes for reducing nitro or nitrile groups to amines. Most large volume aromatic and aliphatic amines are made by continuous high pressure catalytic hydrogenation. Nitro compounds can also be reduced in good yields with iron and hydrochloric acid in the Bèchamp process. Aromatic amines are usually made by hydrogenating the corresponding nitro compound, whereas the aliphatic amines generally start with the corresponding nitrile. In the Bèchamp process, nitro compounds are reduced to amines in the presence of iron and an acid. This is the oldest commercial process for preparing amines, and is still used in the dyestuff industry. The method of reducing aromatic nitro compounds with divalent sulfur is known as Zinin reduction. This reaction is carried out in a basic media using sulfides, polysulfides, or hydrosulfides as the reducing agent. Amines, nitro compounds, nitriles, and the various solvents and reagents used in the preparation of amines by reduction vary widely in the hazards they may pose. Some of these materials are acutely toxic by ingestion, inhalation, or absorption through the skin. Others are skin irritants or sensitizers. Still others, by chronic exposure, may cause damage to organs such as the liver or may be carcinogenic. No general rules can govern their safe use in all cases. Regulations governing the safe handling and shipping of amines are given in U.S. Department of Transportation publications. Specific information on safe handling and hazards can be found in the Material Safety Data Sheet for a given material.},

	abstract = {Advances in flow chemistry to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients ({APIs}) require performing reactions in tailor-made equipment as complexity of the planned setups increases. To react quickly and with low costs to these demanding reactions, additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is a preferred way for the production of customized reactors. This work presents three examples of 3D printed reactors and their application for the synthesis of {API} precursors in continuous flow. The first case deals with an aerobic oxidation of Grignard reagents to the corresponding phenols by molecular oxygen. Here, a design concept was utilized; various stainless steel reactors were tested, and their performances were evaluated in continuous flow. Next, another stainless steel reactor was applied for achieving fast mixing in a cascade, leading to a valsartan precursor. The third and final case employed a continuous stirred tank reactor ({CSTR}) made of a {UV}-curable resin. It was used for the first step of a multiphase enzymatic decarboxylation followed by a Heck cross-coupling reaction, leading to resveratrol derivatives.},
