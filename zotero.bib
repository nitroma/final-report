	abstract = {The innovative Bürkert diaphragm valve Type 3323 is the solution when it comes to on/off control in areas with media contact such as the food and beverage, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and biopharma industry. The electromotive actuator with ball screw shuts the valve quasi delay free with – for electromotive actuators – a unique high control speed within 1.5 to 4.5 seconds. If necessary, the safety position can be realised with optional energy pack in case of power failure. Pressure fluctuations or shocks in the medium are not transferred to the valve position. Furthermore, many helpful functions for process control, valve diagnostics and preventive maintenance are available. Besides the mechanical position indicator, a 360° {LED} illuminated ring displays the valve position and information about warnings and errors. Various communication standards up to cutting-edge fieldbus systems are available. Trusted valve bodies and diaphragms ensure media separation with minimum empty space and are easy to clean. Demanding environments are no problem for the Type 3323 with its high {IP} protection and high resistance to vibration and shocks. Hygienic design allows a fast and residue-free exterior cleaning. The actuator force can be exactly adjusted for the operating conditions to maximise the diaphragm life time.},

Modular production concepts can be used to serve such volatile customer demand more efficiently. Modular plants increase the tactical flexibility of the supply chain substantially compared to centralized production with large-scale plants. Furthermore, production facilities can be flexibly opened, deactivated and reactivated. Modular plants can be relocated in the medium term, and their production capabilities can be reconfigured via process module changes. This work proposes new mixed-integer programming formulations for the tactical planning of production networks in the chemical industry; these formulations prescribe the volume, location, and process of modular plants in the production network over a multi-period planning horizon. The economic value of modular flexibility is investigated in a case study from the chemical industry under the consideration of diverse demand structures. The results have several managerial implications for the technical implementation and development of modular production technology in the chemical industry.},

As the pharmaceutical industry is relatively solvent-intensive, solvent recovery is necessary to achieve the goal of sustainable manufacturing. A simple vapor–liquid equilibrium ({VLE}) setup was designed, and its reliability was assessed, from which the {VLE} data for a two-solvent system were obtained and, accordingly, the distillation columns were designed. The recovered solvent purities were {\textgreater}99.9 wt \% for the first solvent (Solvent 1) and {\textgreater}99.8 wt \% for the second solvent (Solvent 2), and the recovery yields were 94.9\% and 98.3\%, respectively. From the E-factor analysis, approximately 30\% less waste was generated in the {ICM} process compared with a corresponding batch process. After integration of the solvent recovery system, the E-factors for both the batch and {ICM} processes decreased significantly, from 1.63 to 0.29 and from 0.77 to 0.21, respectively.},

The key advantages of continuous flow include faster and safer reactions, which can be more environmentally friendly, smaller footprint, better quality product, and critically, the ability to perform chemistry that is difficult or impossible to do in batch mode. Globally, significant efforts have been made to develop the manufacturing flexibility and robustness of processes used to produce chemicals in a continuous way, yet despite these scientific developments, a major challenge for industry is the established application of flow technology to commercially relevant examples. The identification of opportunities to apply flow solutions to current processes is also critical to the success of this new technology for pharmaceutical and fine chemical companies.

It proved to be a useful tool for revealing intrinsically fast kinetics as well as for optimizing processes with such kinetics. Very encouraging results were achieved for a phase-transfer-catalyzed (ptc) Darzen's reaction to prepare a drug intermediate and the recrystallization of an active pharmaceutical ingredient ({API}). In comparison to presently used batch processes, the ptc reaction resulted in a reaction with 99.9\% reduced reaction time, 99\% reduced inventory, and 93\% reduced impurity level. The recrystallization yielded particles with a tight particle size distribution and a mean size of around 3 μm. Reactor modeling was in good agreement with the experimental results and highlighted the advantages of the process-intensified equipment with a production capacity of around 8 tonnes/year.},

	abstract = {Off-patent pharmaceuticals ({OPPs}) represent more than 60\% of the pharmaceutical market in many emerging countries, where they are frequently evaluated primarily on cost rather than with health technology assessment. {OPPs} are assumed to be identical to the originators. Branded and unbranded generic versions can, however, vary from the originator in active pharmaceutical ingredients, dosage, consistency formulation, excipients, manufacturing processes, and distribution, for example. These variables can alter the efficacy and safety of the product, negatively impacting both the anticipated cost savings and the population’s health. In addition, many health care systems lack the resources or expertise to evaluate such products, and current assessment methods can be complex and difficult to adapt to a health system’s needs. Multicriteria decision analysis ({MCDA}) simple scoring is an evidence-based health technology assessment methodology for evaluating {OPPs}, especially in emerging countries in which resources are limited but decision makers still must balance affordability with factors such as drug safety, level interchangeability, manufacturing site and active pharmaceutical ingredient quality, supply track record, and real-life outcomes. {MCDA} simple scoring can be applied to pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement, formulary listing, and drug procurement. In November 2015, a workshop was held at the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Annual Meeting in Milan to refine and prioritize criteria that can be used in {MCDA} simple scoring for {OPPs}, resulting in an example {MCDA} process and 22 prioritized criteria that health care systems in emerging countries can easily adapt to their own decision-making processes.},

	title = {Multi-criteria decision-making in whole process design},
	url = {http://theses.ncl.ac.uk/jspui/handle/10443/1838},
	abstract = {In recent years, the chemical and pharmaceutical industries have faced increased development times and costs with fewer novel chemicals being discovered. This has resulted in many companies focusing on innovative research and development as they consider this key to business success. In particular, a number of leading industrial organisations have adopted the principles of Whole Process Design ({WPD}). {WPD} considers the optimisation of the entire product development process, from raw materials to end product, rather than focusing on each individual unit operation. The complexity involved in the implementation of {WPD} requires rationalised decision-making, often with limited or uncertain information. This thesis assesses the most widely applied methods in Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis ({MCDA}) in conjunction with the results of two interviews and two questionnaires that identified the industrial requirements for decision-making during {WPD}. From the findings of this work, a novel decision-making methodology was proposed, the outcome of which allows a decision-maker to visually interpret their decision results with associated levels of uncertainty. To validate the proposed methodology, a software framework was developed that incorporates two other decision-making approaches, the Analytical Hierarchy Process ({AHP}) and {ELimination} Et Choix Traduisant la {REalité} trois ({ELECTRE} {III}). The framework was then applied to a number of industrial case studies to validate the application of the proposed methodology.},

	abstract = {The potential of o-nitrotoluene and p-nitrotoluene to cause cancer in mammalian species was studied in male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. These chemicals are on the {EPA} list of high production chemicals and there is potential for human exposure (High Production Volume Chemical List (2000) http://oaspub.cpa.gov/opptintr/chemrtk/volchall.htm.). o-Nitrotoluene, administered in the feed for up to 2 years, caused clear evidence for cancer at multiple sites in rats and mice. Male rats, receiving o-nitrotoluene in the feed (∼0, 25, 50, or 90 mg/kg per day), developed treatment-related mesotheliomas, subcutaneous skin neoplasms, mammary gland fibroadenomas, and liver neoplasms. By 2 years, mesotheliomas, skin, liver, mammary gland and liver tumors also occurred in ‘stop-study’ male rats that received o-nitrotoluene at 125 or 315 mg/kg per day for only the first 3 months of study. These ‘stop-studies’ showed that the critical events leading to tumor formation occurred after 3 months of dosing, and these events were irreversible and eventually led to cancer at multiple sites. o-Nitrotoluene given in the feed to female rats (∼0, 30, 60, or 100 mg/kg per day) and to male and female mice (∼0, 150, 320, or 700 mg/kg per day) also caused a carcinogenic response. In female rats, treatment-related subcutaneous skin neoplasms and mammary gland fibroadenomas occurred. Hemangiosarcomas and carcinomas of the large intestine (cecum) were seen in treated male and female mice. In contrast to o-nitrotoluene, p-nitrotoluene given in the feed over approximately the same exposure levels caused only equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in male rats (subcutaneous skin neoplasms); some evidence of carcinogenic activity in female rats (clitoral gland neoplasms); equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in male mice (lung neoplasms); and no evidence of carcinogenic activity in female mice. Differences in the o-nitrotoluene and p-nitrotoluene carcinogenic activity may be due to differences in the metabolism of the parent compound to carcinogenic metabolites.},

Moreover, acridine was subjected to deprotometalation by recourse to a lithium-zinc base and converted to the corresponding 4-iodo derivative, which was involved in copper-catalyzed couplings with pyrrolidinone and pyrazole. Finally, addition of pyrazole, indole and carbazole onto the 9 position of bare acridine was improved. While moderate biological activity was noticed in melanoma cells growth inhibition, the newly prepared compounds feature interesting photophysical properties which were evaluated in a preliminary study.},

Physical Data: mp 38–39 °C. Solubility: sol ether, alcohol. Preparative Methods: the reagent is best when freshly prepared. At one time it was commercially available but samples more than a few months old were found to be essentially useless due to oligomerization. The propensity of the reagent to self-react and the resulting oligomer structures have been extensively discussed.a A useful preparative method involves Iron({II}) Sulfate reduction of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde. The key to success is limiting the reaction time to 8–10 min and immediate, rapid steam distillation of the reaction product. The precursor is commercially available from a variety of sources and its preparation has also been reported. A supposedly simplified procedure has been suggested but it does not differ significantly from the earlier method. Purification: can be effected by steam distillation from saturated {NaCl} solution. Handling, Storage, and Precautions: the reagent can be stored for periods of up to several months under an inert atmosphere at 0 °C in the dark. The mp is a good general indicator of purity and the {NMR} spectrum should show an aldehyde proton integrating 1∶4 against the aromatic protons. Use in a fume hood.},

	abstract = {Aromatic nitration is one of the most important unit processes in synthetic organic chemistry and in the chemical industry. Particularly, nitrophenols are important precursors for the production of dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, explosives, plastics, and other industrially important products. Many commercial processes are available for the production of these important nitro precursors, but some processes are commonly lead to mixtures of regioisomers and are not environmentally friendly. Thus, in recent years many scientists have been developed new methodologies to improve selectivity and yield of the products. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the synthesis of nitrophenols by green chemistry approaches.},

However, a bio-production platform has not been implemented. Here we constructed a bacterial platform for para-substituted aminobenzene relatives of aromatic amines via enzymes in an alternate shikimate pathway predicted in a Pseudomonad bacterium. Optimization of the metabolic pathway in Escherichia coli cells converted biomass glucose to 4-aminophenylalanine with high efficiency (4.4 g L−1 in fed-batch cultivation). We designed and produced artificial pathways that mimicked the fungal Ehrlich pathway in E. coli and converted 4-aminophenylalanine into 4-aminophenylethanol and 4-aminophenylacetate at 90\% molar yields. Combining these conversion systems or fungal phenylalanine decarboxylases, the 4-aminophenylalanine-producing platform fermented glucose to 4-aminophenylethanol, 4-aminophenylacetate and 4-phenylethylamine. This original bacterial platform for producing artificial aromatic amines highlights their potential as heteroatoms containing bio-based materials that can replace those derived from petroleum.},

 of good quality is core to the manufacturing of effective
 and safe essential drugs. The price of {APIs} is the main cost
 driver for manufacturing. Only a limited number of large
 manufacturers of finished pharmaceutical products have their
 own {API} manufacturing capabilities, and none of them can
 make all required {APIs} in-house. The majority of
 manufacturers, including all those located in Sub-Saharan
 Africa (with the exception of one company in South Africa)
 have to buy all {APIs} in the open market. The paper tries to
 make the structures of the {API} market more transparent,
 trying to determine how difficult it is for small
 manufacturers in developing countries to navigate the global
 {API} market and ensure that they get a quality product at a
 fair price. It also looks into the competitiveness of the
 market, trying to assess the risk that manufacturers or
 traders monopolize parts of the {API} market for essential
 medicines with low commercial attractiveness. The author
 confirms the initial assumption that the {API} market provides
 a challenge in particular to small manufacturers, who have
 limited means to verify the quality of the {APIs} they are
 buying. One potential way to address this problem would be
 to broaden the World Health Organization ({WHO})
 prequalification system to include {APIs} for drugs that are
 on the {WHO} model list for essential medicines.},

The average catalytic activity and initial rate of hydrogenation was found to increase with increase in the solvent polarity. To investigate the intrinsic kinetics of the reaction, the effect of catalyst loading, agitation speed, p-nitrophenol concentration, and hydrogen partial pressure on the initial rate of hydrogenation was studied at different temperatures. The analysis of initial rate data indicated that the mass-transfer resistances were not significant under the prevailing reaction conditions. A simple Langmuir−Hinschelwood (L−H)-type model was found to represent the kinetics of hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol to p-aminophenol satisfactorily. The apparent energy of activation was found to be 61 {kJ}/mol.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              There are persistent gaps in access to affordable medicines. The {WHO} Model List of Essential Medicines ({EML}) includes medicines considered necessary for functional health systems.
            
            
              Methods
              A generic price estimation formula was developed by reviewing published analyses of cost of production for medicines and assuming manufacture in India, which included costs of formulation, packaging, taxation and a 10\% profit margin. Data on per-kilogram prices of active pharmaceutical ingredient exported from India were retrieved from an online database. Estimated prices were compared with the lowest globally available prices for {HIV}/{AIDS}, tuberculosis ({TB}) and malaria medicines, and current prices in the {UK}, South Africa and India.
            
            
              Results
              The estimation formula had good predictive accuracy for {HIV}/{AIDS}, {TB} and malaria medicines. Estimated generic prices ranged from {US}\$0.01 to {US}\$1.45 per unit, with most in the lower end of this range. Lowest available prices were greater than estimated generic prices for 214/277 (77\%) comparable items in the {UK}, 142/212 (67\%) in South Africa and 118/298 (40\%) in India. Lowest available prices were more than three times above estimated generic price for 47\% of cases compared in the {UK} and 22\% in South Africa.
            
            
              Conclusion
              A wide range of medicines in the {EML} can be profitably manufactured at very low cost. Most {EML} medicines are sold in the {UK} and South Africa at prices significantly higher than those estimated from production costs. Generic price estimation and international price comparisons could empower government price negotiations and support cost-effectiveness calculations.},

dinitrotoluene to toluenediamine in a plug flow reactor system incorporating the monolith
catalyst. The process generally comprises the steps:
   introducing a feedstock comprised of dinitrotoluene and reaction product
components continuously into the reactor and said feedstock preferably having less that 30\% by
weight of a solvent, carrying out the hydrogenation of dinitrotoluene to toluenediamine under
adiabatic conditions; and, continuously removing hydrogenated reaction product from the reactor.},

The estimated mass transfer coefficient showed similar nature in the laboratory-scale and the pilot-scale pinched-tube reactor, ensuring similar performance at the pilot scale. Di-nitration in continuous flow, inline quenching, extraction, and phase separation are some of the salient features of the developed pilot plant. The importance of the start-up time for achieving steady state in the flow system at the large scale is highlighted.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the nitration of 2,4-dinitrotoluene ({DNT}) and its conversion to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene ({TNT}) at a gram scale with the use of a fully automated ﬂow chemistry system. The conversion of {DNT} to {TNT} traditionally requires the use of highly hazardous reagents like fuming sulfuric acid (oleum), fuming nitric acid (90–100\%), and elevated temperatures. Flow chemistry oﬀers advantages compared to conventional syntheses including a high degree of safety and simpler multistep automation. The conﬁguration and development of this automated process based on a commercially available ﬂow chemistry system is described. A high conversion rate ({\textgreater}99\%) was achieved. Unlike established synthetic methods, ordinary nitrating mixture (65\% {HNO}3/98\% H2SO4) and shorter reaction times (10–30 min) were applied. The viability of ﬂow nitration as a means of safe and continuous synthesis of {TNT} was investigated. The method was optimized using an experimental design approach, and the resulting process is safer, faster, and more eﬃcient than previously reported {TNT} synthesis procedures. We compared the ﬂow chemistry and batch approaches, including a provisional cost calculation for laboratory-scale production (a thorough economic analysis is, however, beyond the scope of this article). The method is considered ﬁt for purpose for the safe production of high-purity explosives standards at a gram scale, which are used to verify that the performance of explosive trace detection equipment complies with {EU} regulatory requirements.},

Such reactions often cause time delays to the delivery of larger batches of intermediates or ﬁnal compounds for medicinal chemistry projects, because considerable time is required for safety evaluation and, if necessary, modiﬁcation of the procedure so that it can be scaled-up and run in a safe manner.
