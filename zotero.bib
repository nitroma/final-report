	abstract = {The catalytic hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol to p-aminophenol was investigated in a laboratory-scale batch-slurry reactor. Pt/C catalyst (1\%) was chosen for optimization of reaction conditions and kinetic studies because of its higher catalytic activity compared to that of other heterogeneous transition metal catalysts. The average catalytic activity and initial rate of hydrogenation was found to increase with increase in the solvent polarity. To investigate the intrinsic kinetics of the reaction, the effect of catalyst loading, agitation speed, p-nitrophenol concentration, and hydrogen partial pressure on the initial rate of hydrogenation was studied at different temperatures. The analysis of initial rate data indicated that the mass-transfer resistances were not significant under the prevailing reaction conditions. A simple Langmuir−Hinschelwood (L−H)-type model was found to represent the kinetics of hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol to p-aminophenol satisfactorily. The apparent energy of activation was found to be 61 {kJ}/mol.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              There are persistent gaps in access to affordable medicines. The {WHO} Model List of Essential Medicines ({EML}) includes medicines considered necessary for functional health systems.
            
            
              Methods
              A generic price estimation formula was developed by reviewing published analyses of cost of production for medicines and assuming manufacture in India, which included costs of formulation, packaging, taxation and a 10\% profit margin. Data on per-kilogram prices of active pharmaceutical ingredient exported from India were retrieved from an online database. Estimated prices were compared with the lowest globally available prices for {HIV}/{AIDS}, tuberculosis ({TB}) and malaria medicines, and current prices in the {UK}, South Africa and India.
            
            
              Results
              The estimation formula had good predictive accuracy for {HIV}/{AIDS}, {TB} and malaria medicines. Estimated generic prices ranged from {US}\$0.01 to {US}\$1.45 per unit, with most in the lower end of this range. Lowest available prices were greater than estimated generic prices for 214/277 (77\%) comparable items in the {UK}, 142/212 (67\%) in South Africa and 118/298 (40\%) in India. Lowest available prices were more than three times above estimated generic price for 47\% of cases compared in the {UK} and 22\% in South Africa.
            
            
              Conclusion
              A wide range of medicines in the {EML} can be profitably manufactured at very low cost. Most {EML} medicines are sold in the {UK} and South Africa at prices significantly higher than those estimated from production costs. Generic price estimation and international price comparisons could empower government price negotiations and support cost-effectiveness calculations.},

nitroaromatic composition namely dinitrotoluene by contacting the dinitrotoluene with
hydrogen in a reactor employing a monolith catalyst system. Broadly the improvement
resides in the continuous, essentially solventless, adiabatic hydrogenation of
dinitrotoluene to toluenediamine in a plug flow reactor system incorporating the monolith
catalyst. The process generally comprises the steps:
   introducing a feedstock comprised of dinitrotoluene and reaction product
components continuously into the reactor and said feedstock preferably having less that 30\% by
weight of a solvent, carrying out the hydrogenation of dinitrotoluene to toluenediamine under
adiabatic conditions; and, continuously removing hydrogenated reaction product from the reactor.},

The di-nitration reaction follows second-order kinetics where the reaction is first order with respect to both reactant and nitric acid. The pinched-tube reactor was chosen for pilot-scale reactor fabrication due to its excellent mixing and mass transfer characteristics compared to a straighttube reactor. The estimated mass transfer coefficient showed similar nature in the laboratory-scale and the pilot-scale pinched-tube reactor, ensuring similar performance at the pilot scale. Di-nitration in continuous flow, inline quenching, extraction, and phase separation are some of the salient features of the developed pilot plant. The importance of the start-up time for achieving steady state in the flow system at the large scale is highlighted.},

The conversion of {DNT} to {TNT} traditionally requires the use of highly hazardous reagents like fuming sulfuric acid (oleum), fuming nitric acid (90–100\%), and elevated temperatures. Flow chemistry oﬀers advantages compared to conventional syntheses including a high degree of safety and simpler multistep automation. The conﬁguration and development of this automated process based on a commercially available ﬂow chemistry system is described. A high conversion rate ({\textgreater}99\%) was achieved. Unlike established synthetic methods, ordinary nitrating mixture (65\% {HNO}3/98\% H2SO4) and shorter reaction times (10–30 min) were applied. The viability of ﬂow nitration as a means of safe and continuous synthesis of {TNT} was investigated. The method was optimized using an experimental design approach, and the resulting process is safer, faster, and more eﬃcient than previously reported {TNT} synthesis procedures. We compared the ﬂow chemistry and batch approaches, including a provisional cost calculation for laboratory-scale production (a thorough economic analysis is, however, beyond the scope of this article). The method is considered ﬁt for purpose for the safe production of high-purity explosives standards at a gram scale, which are used to verify that the performance of explosive trace detection equipment complies with {EU} regulatory requirements.},
