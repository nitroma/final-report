These chemicals are on the {EPA} list of high production chemicals and there is potential for human exposure (High Production Volume Chemical List (2000) http://oaspub.cpa.gov/opptintr/chemrtk/volchall.htm.). o-Nitrotoluene, administered in the feed for up to 2 years, caused clear evidence for cancer at multiple sites in rats and mice. Male rats, receiving o-nitrotoluene in the feed (∼0, 25, 50, or 90 mg/kg per day), developed treatment-related mesotheliomas, subcutaneous skin neoplasms, mammary gland fibroadenomas, and liver neoplasms. By 2 years, mesotheliomas, skin, liver, mammary gland and liver tumors also occurred in ‘stop-study’ male rats that received o-nitrotoluene at 125 or 315 mg/kg per day for only the first 3 months of study. These ‘stop-studies’ showed that the critical events leading to tumor formation occurred after 3 months of dosing, and these events were irreversible and eventually led to cancer at multiple sites. o-Nitrotoluene given in the feed to female rats (∼0, 30, 60, or 100 mg/kg per day) and to male and female mice (∼0, 150, 320, or 700 mg/kg per day) also caused a carcinogenic response. In female rats, treatment-related subcutaneous skin neoplasms and mammary gland fibroadenomas occurred. Hemangiosarcomas and carcinomas of the large intestine (cecum) were seen in treated male and female mice. In contrast to o-nitrotoluene, p-nitrotoluene given in the feed over approximately the same exposure levels caused only equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in male rats (subcutaneous skin neoplasms); some evidence of carcinogenic activity in female rats (clitoral gland neoplasms); equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in male mice (lung neoplasms); and no evidence of carcinogenic activity in female mice. Differences in the o-nitrotoluene and p-nitrotoluene carcinogenic activity may be due to differences in the metabolism of the parent compound to carcinogenic metabolites.},

Moreover, acridine was subjected to deprotometalation by recourse to a lithium-zinc base and converted to the corresponding 4-iodo derivative, which was involved in copper-catalyzed couplings with pyrrolidinone and pyrazole. Finally, addition of pyrazole, indole and carbazole onto the 9 position of bare acridine was improved. While moderate biological activity was noticed in melanoma cells growth inhibition, the newly prepared compounds feature interesting photophysical properties which were evaluated in a preliminary study.},

Physical Data: mp 38–39 °C. Solubility: sol ether, alcohol. Preparative Methods: the reagent is best when freshly prepared. At one time it was commercially available but samples more than a few months old were found to be essentially useless due to oligomerization. The propensity of the reagent to self-react and the resulting oligomer structures have been extensively discussed.a A useful preparative method involves Iron({II}) Sulfate reduction of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde. The key to success is limiting the reaction time to 8–10 min and immediate, rapid steam distillation of the reaction product. The precursor is commercially available from a variety of sources and its preparation has also been reported. A supposedly simplified procedure has been suggested but it does not differ significantly from the earlier method. Purification: can be effected by steam distillation from saturated {NaCl} solution. Handling, Storage, and Precautions: the reagent can be stored for periods of up to several months under an inert atmosphere at 0 °C in the dark. The mp is a good general indicator of purity and the {NMR} spectrum should show an aldehyde proton integrating 1∶4 against the aromatic protons. Use in a fume hood.},

However, a bio-production platform has not been implemented.

Optimization of the metabolic pathway in Escherichia coli cells converted biomass glucose to 4-aminophenylalanine with high efficiency (4.4 g L−1 in fed-batch cultivation). We designed and produced artificial pathways that mimicked the fungal Ehrlich pathway in E. coli and converted 4-aminophenylalanine into 4-aminophenylethanol and 4-aminophenylacetate at 90\% molar yields. Combining these conversion systems or fungal phenylalanine decarboxylases, the 4-aminophenylalanine-producing platform fermented glucose to 4-aminophenylethanol, 4-aminophenylacetate and 4-phenylethylamine. This original bacterial platform for producing artificial aromatic amines highlights their potential as heteroatoms containing bio-based materials that can replace those derived from petroleum.},

 of good quality is core to the manufacturing of effective

 driver for manufacturing. Only a limited number of large
 manufacturers of finished pharmaceutical products have their
 own {API} manufacturing capabilities, and none of them can
 make all required {APIs} in-house. The majority of
 manufacturers, including all those located in Sub-Saharan
 Africa (with the exception of one company in South Africa)
 have to buy all {APIs} in the open market. The paper tries to
 make the structures of the {API} market more transparent,
 trying to determine how difficult it is for small
 manufacturers in developing countries to navigate the global
 {API} market and ensure that they get a quality product at a
 fair price. It also looks into the competitiveness of the
 market, trying to assess the risk that manufacturers or
 traders monopolize parts of the {API} market for essential
 medicines with low commercial attractiveness. The author
 confirms the initial assumption that the {API} market provides
 a challenge in particular to small manufacturers, who have
 limited means to verify the quality of the {APIs} they are
 buying. One potential way to address this problem would be
 to broaden the World Health Organization ({WHO})
 prequalification system to include {APIs} for drugs that are

	abstract = {The catalytic hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol to p-aminophenol was investigated in a laboratory-scale batch-slurry reactor. Pt/C catalyst (1\%) was chosen for optimization of reaction conditions and kinetic studies because of its higher catalytic activity compared to that of other heterogeneous transition metal catalysts. The average catalytic activity and initial rate of hydrogenation was found to increase with increase in the solvent polarity. To investigate the intrinsic kinetics of the reaction, the effect of catalyst loading, agitation speed, p-nitrophenol concentration, and hydrogen partial pressure on the initial rate of hydrogenation was studied at different temperatures. The analysis of initial rate data indicated that the mass-transfer resistances were not significant under the prevailing reaction conditions. A simple Langmuir−Hinschelwood (L−H)-type model was found to represent the kinetics of hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol to p-aminophenol satisfactorily. The apparent energy of activation was found to be 61 {kJ}/mol.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              There are persistent gaps in access to affordable medicines. The {WHO} Model List of Essential Medicines ({EML}) includes medicines considered necessary for functional health systems.
            
            
              Methods
              A generic price estimation formula was developed by reviewing published analyses of cost of production for medicines and assuming manufacture in India, which included costs of formulation, packaging, taxation and a 10\% profit margin. Data on per-kilogram prices of active pharmaceutical ingredient exported from India were retrieved from an online database. Estimated prices were compared with the lowest globally available prices for {HIV}/{AIDS}, tuberculosis ({TB}) and malaria medicines, and current prices in the {UK}, South Africa and India.
            
            
              Results
              The estimation formula had good predictive accuracy for {HIV}/{AIDS}, {TB} and malaria medicines. Estimated generic prices ranged from {US}\$0.01 to {US}\$1.45 per unit, with most in the lower end of this range. Lowest available prices were greater than estimated generic prices for 214/277 (77\%) comparable items in the {UK}, 142/212 (67\%) in South Africa and 118/298 (40\%) in India. Lowest available prices were more than three times above estimated generic price for 47\% of cases compared in the {UK} and 22\% in South Africa.
            
            
              Conclusion
              A wide range of medicines in the {EML} can be profitably manufactured at very low cost. Most {EML} medicines are sold in the {UK} and South Africa at prices significantly higher than those estimated from production costs. Generic price estimation and international price comparisons could empower government price negotiations and support cost-effectiveness calculations.},

nitroaromatic composition namely dinitrotoluene by contacting the dinitrotoluene with
hydrogen in a reactor employing a monolith catalyst system. Broadly the improvement
resides in the continuous, essentially solventless, adiabatic hydrogenation of
dinitrotoluene to toluenediamine in a plug flow reactor system incorporating the monolith
catalyst. The process generally comprises the steps:
   introducing a feedstock comprised of dinitrotoluene and reaction product
components continuously into the reactor and said feedstock preferably having less that 30\% by
weight of a solvent, carrying out the hydrogenation of dinitrotoluene to toluenediamine under
adiabatic conditions; and, continuously removing hydrogenated reaction product from the reactor.},

The di-nitration reaction follows second-order kinetics where the reaction is first order with respect to both reactant and nitric acid. The pinched-tube reactor was chosen for pilot-scale reactor fabrication due to its excellent mixing and mass transfer characteristics compared to a straighttube reactor. The estimated mass transfer coefficient showed similar nature in the laboratory-scale and the pilot-scale pinched-tube reactor, ensuring similar performance at the pilot scale. Di-nitration in continuous flow, inline quenching, extraction, and phase separation are some of the salient features of the developed pilot plant. The importance of the start-up time for achieving steady state in the flow system at the large scale is highlighted.},

The conversion of {DNT} to {TNT} traditionally requires the use of highly hazardous reagents like fuming sulfuric acid (oleum), fuming nitric acid (90–100\%), and elevated temperatures. Flow chemistry oﬀers advantages compared to conventional syntheses including a high degree of safety and simpler multistep automation. The conﬁguration and development of this automated process based on a commercially available ﬂow chemistry system is described. A high conversion rate ({\textgreater}99\%) was achieved. Unlike established synthetic methods, ordinary nitrating mixture (65\% {HNO}3/98\% H2SO4) and shorter reaction times (10–30 min) were applied. The viability of ﬂow nitration as a means of safe and continuous synthesis of {TNT} was investigated. The method was optimized using an experimental design approach, and the resulting process is safer, faster, and more eﬃcient than previously reported {TNT} synthesis procedures. We compared the ﬂow chemistry and batch approaches, including a provisional cost calculation for laboratory-scale production (a thorough economic analysis is, however, beyond the scope of this article). The method is considered ﬁt for purpose for the safe production of high-purity explosives standards at a gram scale, which are used to verify that the performance of explosive trace detection equipment complies with {EU} regulatory requirements.},
