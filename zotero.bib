	abstract = {The innovative Bürkert diaphragm valve Type 3323 is the solution when it comes to on/off control in areas with media contact such as the food and beverage, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and biopharma industry. The electromotive actuator with ball screw shuts the valve quasi delay free with – for electromotive actuators – a unique high control speed within 1.5 to 4.5 seconds. If necessary, the safety position can be realised with optional energy pack in case of power failure. Pressure fluctuations or shocks in the medium are not transferred to the valve position. Furthermore, many helpful functions for process control, valve diagnostics and preventive maintenance are available. Besides the mechanical position indicator, a 360° {LED} illuminated ring displays the valve position and information about warnings and errors. Various communication standards up to cutting-edge fieldbus systems are available. Trusted valve bodies and diaphragms ensure media separation with minimum empty space and are easy to clean. Demanding environments are no problem for the Type 3323 with its high {IP} protection and high resistance to vibration and shocks. Hygienic design allows a fast and residue-free exterior cleaning. The actuator force can be exactly adjusted for the operating conditions to maximise the diaphragm life time.},

The main objective was the replacement of liquid sulphuric acid. A secondary goal was the increase of 4-{NT} and 2,4-{DNT} in the product mixture, which are more valuable products. Particular consideration was given to the feasibility of future large-scale process implementation. Continuous flow vapour phase reaction, and liquid phase reaction with simultaneous distillation were investigated. {DNT} formation in the vapour phase reaction was negligible with all solid acids tested. Preshaped silica impregnated with sulphuric acid was the most active catalyst but a continuous loss of sulphuric acid with time-on-stream was observed. Zeolite beta provided a higher 4-{NT} to 2-{NT} ratio than {ZSM}-5, {ZSM}-12 and mordenite, but deactivated after 5–10h on-stream. Regeneration of beta was possible by thermal treatment. The para-selectivity of mordenite could be improved by the creation of a mesoporous system. In the reaction with simultaneous distillation, supported liquid acids exhibited true catalytic behaviour for the conversion of {NT} to {DNT}, but a loss of the impregnated acid was observed. Zeolite beta was about half as active as supported liquid acids and gave an exceptionally high 2,4-{DNT} selectivity of up to 94\%, compared to 74–79\% obtained with all other solid acids.},

Among the changes: Updated material reflecting advances in the field since 2001’s Fourth Edition, especially in computational chemistry; A companion Web site provides digital models for study of structure, reaction and selectivity; Solutions to the exercises provided to instructors online. The material in Part A is organized on the basis of fundamental structural topics such as structure, stereochemistry, conformation and aromaticity and basic mechanistic types, including nucleophilic substitution, addition reactions, carbonyl chemistry, aromatic substitution and free radical reactions. Together with Part B: Reaction and Synthesis, the two volumes are intended to provide the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate student in chemistry with a sufficient foundation to comprehend and use the research literature in organic chemistry.},

In the recent literature many authors used different judgment scales which influenced the results and decisions. In this paper the author reviews and discusses effects of utilization of various judgment scales on priority estimation in {AHP}. There has been studies that have been concerned with the comparison of judgment scales but there were no studies concerned with consistency measures that are needed. The goal of this paper is to compare and discuss the application of various judgment scales on the results in particular practical example that has been used in previous paper by Saaty (2003). Thus the focus of the paper is to analyze the impact of using different judgment scales on the resulting priorities and consistency to default scale as proposed by Saaty. Results suggest that judgment scales have a profound impact on criteria priorities but not on ranking of criteria. However, the consistency varies among applied judgment scales. Authors calculated the values of random index needed for calculation of the consistency index in {AHP} for all concerned scales. Based on them the consistency index was computed and compared. Both consistent and inconsistent Saaty matrices were used for comparison.},

The proposed methodology is demonstrated on three widely used decision methods. These methods are the weighted sum model ({WSM}), the weighted product model ({WPM}), and the analytic hierarchy process ({AHP}). This paper formalizes a number of important issues on sensitivity analysis and derives some critical theoretical results. Also, a number of illustrative examples and computational experiments further illustrate the application of the proposed methodology.},

We deﬁne these regimes analytically in several planes of a multi-parametric map, taking into account the different degrees of concentration proﬁle development, as well as the inﬂuence of non-unity orders of reaction and reactant inhibition in the kinetic law. It was found that the regions where conversion can be calculated from simpliﬁed mass transfer models are not discriminated by common results for entrancelength. We also illustrate the trade-offs that exist across this operating map concerning the catalyst design (costs associated with loading and volume) and overall system performance (evaluated in terms of reactant conversion, ﬂow efﬁciency and microreactor effectiveness). It is shown that under certain conditions, the existence of moderate mass transfer resistance can be advantageous (even if internal limitations cannot be avoided), clarifying the role of the intermediate transport-reaction region.},

The conditions for which these regimes occur and the transition criteria are derived here using theoretical analyses for mass transfer in a catalytic layer and in channel ﬂow with a nonlinear wall reaction. The results are expressed in terms of the variables of operation (in temperature diagrams), inlet reference conditions and criteria which can be set as strict as desired (the effectiveness factor or the degree of mass transfer control). Two main behaviors are identiﬁed regarding the major source for transport limitation, for different values of internal and external ‘‘diffusion velocities’’. The transition between them is identiﬁed and the implications on the strategies to achieve overall kinetic or mass transfer control are discussed. Our analysis allow us to map all regimes analytically (inclusively for nonlinear kinetics), whereas in previous literature, numerical evaluation is required even for the simpler case of ﬁrst-order reactions. The more complex effects introduced by kinetic nonlinearities are highlighted, namely the inﬂuence of the reactant local distribution.},

Hybrid electric vehicles provide an alternate mode, at least for the period of improving the technology of electric vehicles. A hybrid electric vehicle is defined as a vehicle with the conventional internal combustion engine and an electric motor as its major sources of power. Experts from different decision-making groups performed the multiple attribute evaluation of alternative vehicles. {AHP} is applied to determine the relative weights of evaluation criteria. {TOPSIS} and {VIKOR} are compared and applied to determine the best compromise alternative fuel mode. The result shows that the hybrid electric bus is the most suitable substitute bus for Taiwan urban areas in the short and median term.

	abstract = {Nitric acid plays an integral role in the reprocessing of irradiated fuel. It is well known that nitric acid degrades; its often yellow hue signifies the presence of decomposition products. The decomposition of nitric acid is accelerated by temperature and radiolysis; therefore it is an important consideration in the reprocessing of nuclear fuels. Thermal and radiolytic reactions of nitric acid result in the formation of redox active nitrogen species, of which nitrous acid is of particular concern, largely due to its redox reactions with plutonium and neptunium. Such reactions are important to understand as plutonium and neptunium can exist in a number of oxidation states; the oxidation state has a direct effect on the species extractability. The effect of nitrous acid is exacerbated as it catalyzes its own production and its reactions with actinides are typically autocatalytic; thus even micromolar quantities can have a large effect. A full understanding of solvent extraction requires us to understand actinide valence states which in turn require us to understand what nitrogen species are present and their concentrations. As a first step in the overall objective of enhancing process models, the kinetic data for nitric acid decomposition reactions has been investigated in order to produce an initial dynamic model of decomposition under aqueous conditions. The identification of a set of kinetic reactions suitable for modelling has been the primary focus of this work. A model of nitric acid thermal decomposition will help develop a better understanding of nitric acid decomposition chemistry and enable better prediction of the oxidation states of species in solution. It is intended to later extend the model to include radiolytic reactions and then further to incorporate an organic phase in order to have a model which covers all decomposition routes for nitric acid within a nuclear fuel reprocessing scheme. The model will be used as a sub model for process models relating to nuclear fuel reprocessing to allow the nitric acid decomposition to be included and the effect of this on operations to be predicted. This is particularly relevant for models of maloperations where different fault scenarios can be investigated and the results of these predicted, as for example unusually high acidity could increase the yields of redox active species significantly altering actinide oxidation states.},

Cobalt is a relatively expensive metal, so catalyst lifetime is crucial to the economics of the process. There are clear advantages in using the regeneration of an aged {FTS} catalyst as a catalyst management tool. Oxidative regeneration of spent cobalt catalysts has been the most favored method in both open and patent literature. Aspects of the oxidation and reduction steps of the regeneration process have been investigated from a fundamental point of view, using both model and realistic catalyst systems. This understanding provided insights into the practical application of regeneration where it is shown that multiple regeneration cycles of the aged catalyst can be performed successfully on the demonstration scale.},

Results showed that adsorption behaviors of p-{NT} in the zeolites were different from o-{NT}. The maximum adsorption amounts of p-{NT} in the zeolites were found to be approximately 4 molecules per unit cell (mol./u.c.), irrespective of adsorption temperatures investigated, which were markedly higher than those of o-{NT}. In addition, the presence of acid sites led to an enhanced affinity of p-{NT} adsorption and to suppressed adsorption of o-{NT} in {HZSM}-5 zeolite compared with silicalite-1. Adsorption kinetic results showed that rate constants of p-{NT} were markedly higher than those of o-{NT} in silicalite-1 and {HZSM}-5 zeolite. For the separation of p-{NT}, enhanced selectivity of {HZSM}-5 zeolite for p-{NT} adsorption was observed compared with silicalite-1. Under our optimized conditions, p-{NT} with purity of 98.2 \% could be recovered with {HZSM}-5 zeolite, which was ascribed to the marked differences in adsorption amounts and rate constants between p-{NT} and o-{NT} in the zeolite.},

In this study, partially fluorinated polystyrene (F-{pSt}) and partially fluorinated polymethyl methacrylate (F-{pMMA}) polymers were used to support novel unsymmetrical cobalt({II}) phthalocyanine({CoPc}) via Huisgen’s Cu(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, referred to as the “click chemistry”, and the resulting new structures were elucidated with various well-known spectroscopic techniques. The photocatalytic activity of the novel heterogeneous F-{pStCoPc} and F-{pMMACoPc} catalysts were estimated for the degradation of two well-known dyes, methylene blue ({MB}) and methyl violet ({MV}) in aqueous medium under illumination with visible light (λ {\textgreater} 400 nm) with or without hydrogen peroxide and/or air at specified {pH} values. {UV}–vis spectrophotometry was employed to determine the concentration of the dyes. {MB} and {MV} (10 ppm, 25 {mL}) were completely dissociated (photochemically) with 20 mg of the reported catalyst in 60 min under atmospheric air. The catalyst reported herein is highly recyclable and does not require the presence of well-known semiconductors like {ZnO}/{TiO}2. Besides, the catalyst is stable over a long time and it is recyclable up to five times (without any deactivation). It has been concluded that this procedure will have a bright future for wastewater treatment and green chemistry.},

In this study, nitration of toluene was conducted in a microreactor immersed in a constant temperature bath using concentrated nitric acid as the nitrating agent. The effects of residence time, reaction temperature, and acid concentration, etc., on the reactor performance were studied. The results indicate that in the microreactor the nitration reaction proceeds rapidly, even without sulfuric acid, probably by self-protonation of nitric acid. Also, no by-products were detected. The isomeric distribution of the product nitrotoluenes was found to be identical to that generally found in the mixed-acid nitration. The results were compared with the data obtained from a batch reactor, and the microreactor reaction rates were found to be much higher than the batch reactor rates.},

The last step, which destroys the desired product, the aldehyde, is crucial. Therefore, for continuous resaturation of the electrolyte with toluene and for extraction of benzaldehyde, the benzaldehyde content in the emulgated organic phase has to be kept below a critical value. For toluene,p-chlorotoluene and xylene Mn3+-mediated oxidation only becomes attractive with process temperatures above 60°C. The conversion ofp-nitrotoluene top-nitrobenzaldehyde can only be carried out by Co3+. The reactivities of the oxidants declines in the order: Co3+{\textgreater}Mn3+{\textgreater}Ce4+. Current efficiencies for the recuperation of all oxidants approaches 100\%.},

The methodology covers a wide range of separation problems and consists of selection and identification of separation techniques (and the corresponding separation tasks), the sequencing of the separation tasks and the determination of appropriate and consistent conditions of operation. For a specified multicomponent separation problem, subsets of feasible separation techniques are first identified for every binary and user-specified separation tasks. The number of alternatives for each separation task is reduced by systematically analyzing the relationships between properties, separation technique and conditions of operation. After the final step, an estimate of the final process flowsheet is produced with a list of possible alternatives for the separation tasks. Application of the methodology is demonstrated through examples highlighting the different steps of the methodology.},

Experiments have been performed with six structured packings with different {AVS} configurations. The experiments have been performed with air, water and 3mm glass beads in a Perspex model system. A clear difference can be observed between continuous and discontinuous {AVS} configurations; only continuous {AVS} configurations are shifting the flooding boundaries to higher gas and liquid fluxes. The {kLa} of all structured packings with {AVS} is comparable to the {kLa} of a cocurrent packed bed. Flooding in structured packings is qualitatively described by identifying three types of liquid flow. These flows can be manipulated with the configuration of the {AVS} and therefore the flooding point can be influenced. By applying {AVS}, flooding can also be prevented completely without loss in mass transfer ({kLa}).},

	abstract = {A two-dimensional two-phase (heterogeneous) model that predicts flow maldistributions and hot spots in an adiabatic down-flow packed bed reactor is developed and analyzed. The model considers the effects of fluid flow, changes of physical properties, heat and mass transfer by conduction and convection, interphase gradients and reactant consumption by an exothermic irreversible first-order reaction with Arrhenius kinetics. The one-dimensional model is analyzed in detail using singularity theory. Linear instability theory is used to determine the boundary of the region of parameters at which the uniform down-flow loses stability, and it is shown that flow maldistributions are possible for typical operating conditions. Bifurcation theory, numerical spectral and continuation methods are combined to determine the different types of nonuniform flow patterns and corresponding temperature and concentration fields. Unlike the pseudohomogeneous model where the maximum exit temperature cannot exceed the adiabatic temperature rise (Pem → ∞), the heterogeneous model can have isolated high temperature branches that exist when particle Lewis number is less than unity. It is shown that this maximum temperature on the isolated branch can be as high as β/Le where β is the adiabatic temperature rise {andLe} is the particle Lewis number (Le {\textless} 1.0). Finally, a possible mechanism for the formation of the localized hot spots observed in commercial reactors is proposed; the interphase resistances cause the existence of very high temperature isolated steady-state branches which are attained by the catalyst particles when maldistributed flows occur.},

Reactant mixture is passed through the reactor at velocities sufficient to fluidize the inerts. Conversions from 0 to 91\% are observed over the temperature range 56° to 261°C and flow rate range 10 to 800 cm3/s.

	abstract = {This chapter explores various technological aspects and conceptual issues relevant to reactor engineering of trickle bed reactors including the industrial applications and engineering science challenges related to design and scale-up. These are gas-liquid-solid contacting devices used in many diverse fields such as the petroleum, petrochemical, fine chemical, and biochemical industries. The trickle bed reactors contribute significantly to manufacturing cleaner fuels by hydrodesulfurization and hydrodenitrogenation reactions in refineries. Several other types of reactions involving hydrogenation, oxidation, alkylation, and chlorination are carried out advantageously in trickle bed reactors. Some examples of the industrial applications of trickle bed reactors are: ethanol oxidation, wet oxidation of phenol, hydrogenation of various petroleum fractions, nitrocompounds, carbonyl compounds, carboxylic acids to alcohols (adipic acid to 1,6-hexanediol), catalytic dewaxing, dearomatization, and others. Current and future emphasis on cleaner fuels and increasing new applications of trickle bed reactors demand in-depth understanding of the engineering tools to enable manipulation and control of the trickle bed reactors for improved performance. In recent years, several variants of trickle bed reactors, including micro reactors and mesh reactors, have been introduced, while the attempts to further develop the design and scale-up methodologies continue. The performance of trickle bed reactors depends on several issues such as characteristics of the catalytic bed (packing configuration, porosity, particle size/coating thickness), flow maldistribution, wetting of catalyst particles and local interphase heat and mass transfer rates, intraparticle mass and heat transfer, and reaction kinetics. The configuration and characteristics of the catalytic bed influence the underlying fluid dynamics and therefore the local transport rates, wetting, and mixing of the fluid phases in trickle bed reactors.},

	abstract = {The liquid phase oxidation of toluene to benzoic acid by pure oxygen has been performed in a bubble reactor by using cobalt acetate tetrahydrate as catalyst. The influence of the oxygen partial pressures on the reaction kinetics were first investigated, and the results showed that the influence was neglectable in the high oxygen pressure range ({\textgreater}0.5 {MPa}) under 155°C. Thereby, the reaction rates in the oxidation using pure oxygen are independent of the oxygen partial pressure and expressed as the first order to liquid reactants. Based on a kinetic scheme that involves both benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde, the kinetic models can well describe the reaction process. Furthermore, the results indicated that the production of benzyl alcohol is much slower than its consumption to form benzaldehyde and the scheme can be further simplified to a kinetic equation, which involves only benzaldehyde as intermediate. The simplified reaction scheme also well describes the reaction, and, thus, the derived kinetic models agree well with the experimental data. The reaction constants follow the Arrhenius law. The estimated activation energies are in the range from 92.63 {kJ}·mol−1 to 67.81 {kJ}·mol−1.},

	abstract = {Amines are derivatives of ammonia in which one or more of the hydrogens is replaced with an alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, or heterocyclic group. When more than one hydrogen has been replaced, the substituents can either be the same or different. Amines are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary depending on the number of hydrogens that have been replaced. Many different types of nitrogen-containing compounds can be reduced to amines. In practice, however, nitriles or nitro compounds are usually used because they are the most easily obtained starting materials. There are several commercial processes for reducing nitro or nitrile groups to amines. Most large volume aromatic and aliphatic amines are made by continuous high pressure catalytic hydrogenation. Nitro compounds can also be reduced in good yields with iron and hydrochloric acid in the Bèchamp process. Aromatic amines are usually made by hydrogenating the corresponding nitro compound, whereas the aliphatic amines generally start with the corresponding nitrile. In the Bèchamp process, nitro compounds are reduced to amines in the presence of iron and an acid. This is the oldest commercial process for preparing amines, and is still used in the dyestuff industry. The method of reducing aromatic nitro compounds with divalent sulfur is known as Zinin reduction. This reaction is carried out in a basic media using sulfides, polysulfides, or hydrosulfides as the reducing agent. Amines, nitro compounds, nitriles, and the various solvents and reagents used in the preparation of amines by reduction vary widely in the hazards they may pose. Some of these materials are acutely toxic by ingestion, inhalation, or absorption through the skin. Others are skin irritants or sensitizers. Still others, by chronic exposure, may cause damage to organs such as the liver or may be carcinogenic. No general rules can govern their safe use in all cases. Regulations governing the safe handling and shipping of amines are given in U.S. Department of Transportation publications. Specific information on safe handling and hazards can be found in the Material Safety Data Sheet for a given material.},

The method comprises the steps of taking toluene and mixed acid of nitric acid/sulfuric acid (n/s) as initial reaction materials, inputting material flow synchronously into a microreactor through a metering pump and finishing mixed mass transfer and reaction in a reaction channel. The substance ratio of n to s in the reactive mixed acid is 0.1 to 1.0, and the mass ratio of water is less than 15 percent. The liquid hourly space velocity in the reactor is 500 to 50,000 h{\textless}-1{\textgreater}. The microchannel reactor adopts a stainless steel flat-plate structure which comprises fixed pressing-sealing plates, a microchannel plate, a raw-material inlet, a product outlet, as well as a temperature-control pore channel and a thermal-couple measurement-control jack which are positioned on two sealing plates. The method is continuously operated under a technological condition with medium/strong nitrating acid, and is safe in process. The conversion rate of the toluene in the reactor at an operation temperature between normal temperature and 80 {DEG} C is higher than 98 percent, and the yield of dinitrotoluene is higher than 95 percent, wherein the ratio of two main isomer components, namely 2,4-dinitrotoluene and 2,6-dinitrotoluene, is more than 4 and can be nearly 5 under optimum conditions.},

The protonated form of Y, {ZSM}-5, and mordenite zeolites as well as strongly acidic cation exchange resin (Amberlite {IR}-120) were examined as triphase catalyst (liquid–liquid–solid) for the nitration of toluene to produce mainly mononitrotoluenes. Among the solid acid catalysts tested, zeolites were found to be more active than cation exchange resin with highest activity for H-mordenite followed by {HZSM}-5 and {HY} zeolites. The reaction was found to be free from external diffusional resistance. The effects of other parameters (temperature, catalyst loading, and nitric acid concentration) on the rate of toluene nitration over H-mordenite catalyst were also investigated. The selectivity for p-nitrotoluene increases with temperature but decreases with increase in nitric acid concentration. The acidity level of the catalyst determines the product distribution; the stronger the acidity, the lower the ortho/para ratio is in the product mixture. The triphasic nitration reaction is kinetically controlled with an activation energy of 24.24 {kJ}/mol. The catalyst could be reused for several cycles with negligible loss in activity.},

In the present work, the problem of pressure drops along foam beds is studied with a new simplistic geometrical model as a first step in the understanding of the peculiar hydrodynamic behavior of {SiC} foams in chemical processes.

	abstract = {Ceramic foams are prepared as positive images of corresponding plastic structures and exhibit bed porosities as high as 80–90\%. This makes them attractive as catalyst supports in processes where high pressure drop in the reactor tube is a problem. In this research, pressure drop relationships were examined for 10, 30, 45 and 65 pores per inch ({PPI}) ceramic foam samples made from 92.0 and 99.5\% α-Al2O3 and from {ZrO}2 stabilized with Mg, Ca, and La2O3. Pore distributions were determined with imaging analysis, using digital techniques. Pressure drop measurements confirmed that ceramic foams follow the Forscheimer relationship and may be interpreted with the Ergun model, in which the pressure drop is the sum of viscous and inertial terms. The Ergun parameters, α and β, are not constant, α decreases from 8.05 to 2.88 and β increases from 0.0338 to 0.111 as the pore density increases from 10 to 65PPI. Empirical equations were developed for these parameters in terms of the mean pore size and the bed porosity, and these indicated a dependence on the media properties. Calculated pressure drop from these equations were within 15\% of measured values. Up to 15wt.\% γ-Al2O3 washcoat was added to 30 {PPI} samples of α-Al2O3 foams. Nitrogen {BET} surface areas increased from about 2m2g−1 in the unwashcoated samples to almost 15m2g−1 at the highest loading. Both α and β increase linearly with the {BET} surface area, α by only about 50\% but β by a factor of 8. This suggests that roughness introduced by the washcoat plays a dominant role in the turbulent resistance.},

Pitch and depth are varied in the case of corrugated tubes. The {ANN} model was developed and validated using a huge databank including 181 experimental datasets. The best training algorithm is the Bayesian regulation. A back-propagation algorithm, which is considered to be the most common learning method for {ANNs}, is used in the training and testing of the network. Different network configurations were tested, and the optimum {ANN} configuration consisted of a network with two hidden layers with 15 and 21 nodes in the first and second layer, respectively. The {ANNs} results were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data, with the absolute average relative deviation ({AARD}) being below 1.91\% for the heat transfer coefficient and below 3.82\% for the pressure drop, respectively.

The most effective {pH} was found to be 5 for {AHC} and 6 for {CAC}. The equilibrium data for {COD} removal fitted the Linear, Langmuir and the Freundlich models. The mechanisms of the rate of adsorption of {COD} were analysed using the pseudo-second-order model.

The poisonous, explosive compound is destined for medical use.

The key to this production process is microreactor technology which employs a system of often miniaturized reactors, mixers, heat exchangers, and other processing elements with internal structures on a micrometer scale (10 to 500μm). Continuous processing based on flow chemistry alone is one advantage. But because of the small channel sizes and high surface area-to-volume ratios, these devices are orders of magnitude more efficient than large-scale batch reactors in heat and mass transfer. Better heat and mass transfer, in turn, can contribute to improved conversion, selectivity ...},

	abstract = {This chapter introduces several of the intensified reactors and discusses reactor theory and the characteristics of reactors. The reactor, the key component of a majority of chemical processes, has received more attention than other unit operations in the context of intensification, which is evident from the large number of intensified reactors either on the market or under development. Reactor engineering has two key elements: reaction kinetics and reactor design. Reactor design is based upon mass balance. However, this is only accurate if the reaction is proceeding at its inherent rate, i.e., there is perfect mixing and mass transfer within the reactor. It is often the case in larger stirred tank design reactors that the reaction is not proceeding at its inherent rate, as it is limited by the mixing within the vessel, i.e., the reactants are not perfectly mixed together. In this case it is said to be “mixing-limited.” The role of process intensification is often to remove such limitations so that the reaction can reach its intrinsic rate. Thus, the aim is to ensure that the mixing and heat/mass transfer rates will be relatively fast compared to the fundamental process kinetics. It is assumed that elevated acceleration is achieved for as long as required by operating within a rotating system. One embodiment of this approach is based on the flow of a liquid film over a rotating surface of revolution as in a spinning flat disc in the spinning disc reactor. The oscillatory baffled reactor is a novel form of continuous plug flow reactor in which tubes fitted with equally spaced, low-constriction orifice plate baffles have an oscillatory motion (range 0.5 to 10 Hz) superimposed upon the net flow of the process fluid. Membrane reactors are becoming increasingly of interest due to their ability to take reactions to completion by continuous product removal.},

	abstract = {Advances in flow chemistry to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients ({APIs}) require performing reactions in tailor-made equipment as complexity of the planned setups increases. To react quickly and with low costs to these demanding reactions, additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is a preferred way for the production of customized reactors. This work presents three examples of 3D printed reactors and their application for the synthesis of {API} precursors in continuous flow. The first case deals with an aerobic oxidation of Grignard reagents to the corresponding phenols by molecular oxygen. Here, a design concept was utilized; various stainless steel reactors were tested, and their performances were evaluated in continuous flow. Next, another stainless steel reactor was applied for achieving fast mixing in a cascade, leading to a valsartan precursor. The third and final case employed a continuous stirred tank reactor ({CSTR}) made of a {UV}-curable resin. It was used for the first step of a multiphase enzymatic decarboxylation followed by a Heck cross-coupling reaction, leading to resveratrol derivatives.},

	abstract = {Shorter product life cycles in the chemical industry have led to uncertain demand in terms of volume, location and type. Modular production concepts can be used to serve such volatile customer demand more efficiently. Modular plants increase the tactical flexibility of the supply chain substantially compared to centralized production with large-scale plants. Furthermore, production facilities can be flexibly opened, deactivated and reactivated. Modular plants can be relocated in the medium term, and their production capabilities can be reconfigured via process module changes. This work proposes new mixed-integer programming formulations for the tactical planning of production networks in the chemical industry; these formulations prescribe the volume, location, and process of modular plants in the production network over a multi-period planning horizon. The economic value of modular flexibility is investigated in a case study from the chemical industry under the consideration of diverse demand structures. The results have several managerial implications for the technical implementation and development of modular production technology in the chemical industry.},

As the pharmaceutical industry is relatively solvent-intensive, solvent recovery is necessary to achieve the goal of sustainable manufacturing. A simple vapor–liquid equilibrium ({VLE}) setup was designed, and its reliability was assessed, from which the {VLE} data for a two-solvent system were obtained and, accordingly, the distillation columns were designed. The recovered solvent purities were {\textgreater}99.9 wt \% for the first solvent (Solvent 1) and {\textgreater}99.8 wt \% for the second solvent (Solvent 2), and the recovery yields were 94.9\% and 98.3\%, respectively. From the E-factor analysis, approximately 30\% less waste was generated in the {ICM} process compared with a corresponding batch process. After integration of the solvent recovery system, the E-factors for both the batch and {ICM} processes decreased significantly, from 1.63 to 0.29 and from 0.77 to 0.21, respectively.},

The key advantages of continuous flow include faster and safer reactions, which can be more environmentally friendly, smaller footprint, better quality product, and critically, the ability to perform chemistry that is difficult or impossible to do in batch mode. Globally, significant efforts have been made to develop the manufacturing flexibility and robustness of processes used to produce chemicals in a continuous way, yet despite these scientific developments, a major challenge for industry is the established application of flow technology to commercially relevant examples. The identification of opportunities to apply flow solutions to current processes is also critical to the success of this new technology for pharmaceutical and fine chemical companies. This review highlights industrial hurdles and the importance of education and showcases recent (2018–2019) and relevant industrial examples where utilization of flow technology has been successfully performed.},

Very encouraging results were achieved for a phase-transfer-catalyzed (ptc) Darzen's reaction to prepare a drug intermediate and the recrystallization of an active pharmaceutical ingredient ({API}). In comparison to presently used batch processes, the ptc reaction resulted in a reaction with 99.9\% reduced reaction time, 99\% reduced inventory, and 93\% reduced impurity level. The recrystallization yielded particles with a tight particle size distribution and a mean size of around 3 μm. Reactor modeling was in good agreement with the experimental results and highlighted the advantages of the process-intensified equipment with a production capacity of around 8 tonnes/year.},

	abstract = {Off-patent pharmaceuticals ({OPPs}) represent more than 60\% of the pharmaceutical market in many emerging countries, where they are frequently evaluated primarily on cost rather than with health technology assessment. {OPPs} are assumed to be identical to the originators. Branded and unbranded generic versions can, however, vary from the originator in active pharmaceutical ingredients, dosage, consistency formulation, excipients, manufacturing processes, and distribution, for example. These variables can alter the efficacy and safety of the product, negatively impacting both the anticipated cost savings and the population’s health. In addition, many health care systems lack the resources or expertise to evaluate such products, and current assessment methods can be complex and difficult to adapt to a health system’s needs. Multicriteria decision analysis ({MCDA}) simple scoring is an evidence-based health technology assessment methodology for evaluating {OPPs}, especially in emerging countries in which resources are limited but decision makers still must balance affordability with factors such as drug safety, level interchangeability, manufacturing site and active pharmaceutical ingredient quality, supply track record, and real-life outcomes. {MCDA} simple scoring can be applied to pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement, formulary listing, and drug procurement. In November 2015, a workshop was held at the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Annual Meeting in Milan to refine and prioritize criteria that can be used in {MCDA} simple scoring for {OPPs}, resulting in an example {MCDA} process and 22 prioritized criteria that health care systems in emerging countries can easily adapt to their own decision-making processes.},

	title = {Multi-criteria decision-making in whole process design},
	url = {http://theses.ncl.ac.uk/jspui/handle/10443/1838},
	abstract = {In recent years, the chemical and pharmaceutical industries have faced increased development times and costs with fewer novel chemicals being discovered. This has resulted in many companies focusing on innovative research and development as they consider this key to business success. In particular, a number of leading industrial organisations have adopted the principles of Whole Process Design ({WPD}). {WPD} considers the optimisation of the entire product development process, from raw materials to end product, rather than focusing on each individual unit operation. The complexity involved in the implementation of {WPD} requires rationalised decision-making, often with limited or uncertain information. This thesis assesses the most widely applied methods in Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis ({MCDA}) in conjunction with the results of two interviews and two questionnaires that identified the industrial requirements for decision-making during {WPD}. From the findings of this work, a novel decision-making methodology was proposed, the outcome of which allows a decision-maker to visually interpret their decision results with associated levels of uncertainty. To validate the proposed methodology, a software framework was developed that incorporates two other decision-making approaches, the Analytical Hierarchy Process ({AHP}) and {ELimination} Et Choix Traduisant la {REalité} trois ({ELECTRE} {III}). The framework was then applied to a number of industrial case studies to validate the application of the proposed methodology.},

	abstract = {The potential of o-nitrotoluene and p-nitrotoluene to cause cancer in mammalian species was studied in male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. These chemicals are on the {EPA} list of high production chemicals and there is potential for human exposure (High Production Volume Chemical List (2000) http://oaspub.cpa.gov/opptintr/chemrtk/volchall.htm.). o-Nitrotoluene, administered in the feed for up to 2 years, caused clear evidence for cancer at multiple sites in rats and mice. Male rats, receiving o-nitrotoluene in the feed (∼0, 25, 50, or 90 mg/kg per day), developed treatment-related mesotheliomas, subcutaneous skin neoplasms, mammary gland fibroadenomas, and liver neoplasms. By 2 years, mesotheliomas, skin, liver, mammary gland and liver tumors also occurred in ‘stop-study’ male rats that received o-nitrotoluene at 125 or 315 mg/kg per day for only the first 3 months of study. These ‘stop-studies’ showed that the critical events leading to tumor formation occurred after 3 months of dosing, and these events were irreversible and eventually led to cancer at multiple sites. o-Nitrotoluene given in the feed to female rats (∼0, 30, 60, or 100 mg/kg per day) and to male and female mice (∼0, 150, 320, or 700 mg/kg per day) also caused a carcinogenic response. In female rats, treatment-related subcutaneous skin neoplasms and mammary gland fibroadenomas occurred. Hemangiosarcomas and carcinomas of the large intestine (cecum) were seen in treated male and female mice. In contrast to o-nitrotoluene, p-nitrotoluene given in the feed over approximately the same exposure levels caused only equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in male rats (subcutaneous skin neoplasms); some evidence of carcinogenic activity in female rats (clitoral gland neoplasms); equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in male mice (lung neoplasms); and no evidence of carcinogenic activity in female mice. Differences in the o-nitrotoluene and p-nitrotoluene carcinogenic activity may be due to differences in the metabolism of the parent compound to carcinogenic metabolites.},

Moreover, acridine was subjected to deprotometalation by recourse to a lithium-zinc base and converted to the corresponding 4-iodo derivative, which was involved in copper-catalyzed couplings with pyrrolidinone and pyrazole. Finally, addition of pyrazole, indole and carbazole onto the 9 position of bare acridine was improved. While moderate biological activity was noticed in melanoma cells growth inhibition, the newly prepared compounds feature interesting photophysical properties which were evaluated in a preliminary study.},

Physical Data: mp 38–39 °C. Solubility: sol ether, alcohol. Preparative Methods: the reagent is best when freshly prepared. At one time it was commercially available but samples more than a few months old were found to be essentially useless due to oligomerization. The propensity of the reagent to self-react and the resulting oligomer structures have been extensively discussed.a A useful preparative method involves Iron({II}) Sulfate reduction of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde. The key to success is limiting the reaction time to 8–10 min and immediate, rapid steam distillation of the reaction product. The precursor is commercially available from a variety of sources and its preparation has also been reported. A supposedly simplified procedure has been suggested but it does not differ significantly from the earlier method. Purification: can be effected by steam distillation from saturated {NaCl} solution. Handling, Storage, and Precautions: the reagent can be stored for periods of up to several months under an inert atmosphere at 0 °C in the dark. The mp is a good general indicator of purity and the {NMR} spectrum should show an aldehyde proton integrating 1∶4 against the aromatic protons. Use in a fume hood.},

	abstract = {Aromatic amines containing an aminobenzene or an aniline moiety comprise versatile natural and artificial compounds including bioactive molecules and resources for advanced materials. However, a bio-production platform has not been implemented. Here we constructed a bacterial platform for para-substituted aminobenzene relatives of aromatic amines via enzymes in an alternate shikimate pathway predicted in a Pseudomonad bacterium. Optimization of the metabolic pathway in Escherichia coli cells converted biomass glucose to 4-aminophenylalanine with high efficiency (4.4 g L−1 in fed-batch cultivation). We designed and produced artificial pathways that mimicked the fungal Ehrlich pathway in E. coli and converted 4-aminophenylalanine into 4-aminophenylethanol and 4-aminophenylacetate at 90\% molar yields. Combining these conversion systems or fungal phenylalanine decarboxylases, the 4-aminophenylalanine-producing platform fermented glucose to 4-aminophenylethanol, 4-aminophenylacetate and 4-phenylethylamine. This original bacterial platform for producing artificial aromatic amines highlights their potential as heteroatoms containing bio-based materials that can replace those derived from petroleum.},

 of good quality is core to the manufacturing of effective
 and safe essential drugs. The price of {APIs} is the main cost
 driver for manufacturing. Only a limited number of large
 manufacturers of finished pharmaceutical products have their
 own {API} manufacturing capabilities, and none of them can
 make all required {APIs} in-house. The majority of
 manufacturers, including all those located in Sub-Saharan
 Africa (with the exception of one company in South Africa)
 have to buy all {APIs} in the open market. The paper tries to
 make the structures of the {API} market more transparent,
 trying to determine how difficult it is for small
 manufacturers in developing countries to navigate the global
 {API} market and ensure that they get a quality product at a
 fair price. It also looks into the competitiveness of the
 market, trying to assess the risk that manufacturers or
 traders monopolize parts of the {API} market for essential
 medicines with low commercial attractiveness. The author
 confirms the initial assumption that the {API} market provides
 a challenge in particular to small manufacturers, who have
 limited means to verify the quality of the {APIs} they are
 buying. One potential way to address this problem would be
 to broaden the World Health Organization ({WHO})
 prequalification system to include {APIs} for drugs that are
 on the {WHO} model list for essential medicines.},

The average catalytic activity and initial rate of hydrogenation was found to increase with increase in the solvent polarity. To investigate the intrinsic kinetics of the reaction, the effect of catalyst loading, agitation speed, p-nitrophenol concentration, and hydrogen partial pressure on the initial rate of hydrogenation was studied at different temperatures. The analysis of initial rate data indicated that the mass-transfer resistances were not significant under the prevailing reaction conditions. A simple Langmuir−Hinschelwood (L−H)-type model was found to represent the kinetics of hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol to p-aminophenol satisfactorily. The apparent energy of activation was found to be 61 {kJ}/mol.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              There are persistent gaps in access to affordable medicines. The {WHO} Model List of Essential Medicines ({EML}) includes medicines considered necessary for functional health systems.
            
            
              Methods
              A generic price estimation formula was developed by reviewing published analyses of cost of production for medicines and assuming manufacture in India, which included costs of formulation, packaging, taxation and a 10\% profit margin. Data on per-kilogram prices of active pharmaceutical ingredient exported from India were retrieved from an online database. Estimated prices were compared with the lowest globally available prices for {HIV}/{AIDS}, tuberculosis ({TB}) and malaria medicines, and current prices in the {UK}, South Africa and India.
            
            
              Results
              The estimation formula had good predictive accuracy for {HIV}/{AIDS}, {TB} and malaria medicines. Estimated generic prices ranged from {US}\$0.01 to {US}\$1.45 per unit, with most in the lower end of this range. Lowest available prices were greater than estimated generic prices for 214/277 (77\%) comparable items in the {UK}, 142/212 (67\%) in South Africa and 118/298 (40\%) in India. Lowest available prices were more than three times above estimated generic price for 47\% of cases compared in the {UK} and 22\% in South Africa.
            
            
              Conclusion
              A wide range of medicines in the {EML} can be profitably manufactured at very low cost. Most {EML} medicines are sold in the {UK} and South Africa at prices significantly higher than those estimated from production costs. Generic price estimation and international price comparisons could empower government price negotiations and support cost-effectiveness calculations.},

dinitrotoluene to toluenediamine in a plug flow reactor system incorporating the monolith
catalyst. The process generally comprises the steps:
   introducing a feedstock comprised of dinitrotoluene and reaction product
components continuously into the reactor and said feedstock preferably having less that 30\% by
weight of a solvent, carrying out the hydrogenation of dinitrotoluene to toluenediamine under
adiabatic conditions; and, continuously removing hydrogenated reaction product from the reactor.},

The pinched-tube reactor was chosen for pilot-scale reactor fabrication due to its excellent mixing and mass transfer characteristics compared to a straighttube reactor. The estimated mass transfer coefficient showed similar nature in the laboratory-scale and the pilot-scale pinched-tube reactor, ensuring similar performance at the pilot scale. Di-nitration in continuous flow, inline quenching, extraction, and phase separation are some of the salient features of the developed pilot plant. The importance of the start-up time for achieving steady state in the flow system at the large scale is highlighted.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the nitration of 2,4-dinitrotoluene ({DNT}) and its conversion to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene ({TNT}) at a gram scale with the use of a fully automated ﬂow chemistry system. The conversion of {DNT} to {TNT} traditionally requires the use of highly hazardous reagents like fuming sulfuric acid (oleum), fuming nitric acid (90–100\%), and elevated temperatures. Flow chemistry oﬀers advantages compared to conventional syntheses including a high degree of safety and simpler multistep automation. The conﬁguration and development of this automated process based on a commercially available ﬂow chemistry system is described. A high conversion rate ({\textgreater}99\%) was achieved. Unlike established synthetic methods, ordinary nitrating mixture (65\% {HNO}3/98\% H2SO4) and shorter reaction times (10–30 min) were applied. The viability of ﬂow nitration as a means of safe and continuous synthesis of {TNT} was investigated. The method was optimized using an experimental design approach, and the resulting process is safer, faster, and more eﬃcient than previously reported {TNT} synthesis procedures. We compared the ﬂow chemistry and batch approaches, including a provisional cost calculation for laboratory-scale production (a thorough economic analysis is, however, beyond the scope of this article). The method is considered ﬁt for purpose for the safe production of high-purity explosives standards at a gram scale, which are used to verify that the performance of explosive trace detection equipment complies with {EU} regulatory requirements.},

Such reactions often cause time delays to the delivery of larger batches of intermediates or ﬁnal compounds for medicinal chemistry projects, because considerable time is required for safety evaluation and, if necessary, modiﬁcation of the procedure so that it can be scaled-up and run in a safe manner. A commercially available continuous ﬂow reactor was used in the scale up of three challenging nitrations including a reaction involving a potentially explosive mixture of acetic acid and fuming nitric acid, with a productivity of 97 g/h.},

	abstract = {The focus of this paper is on one of the important steps in designing plant-wide control systems, namely, control degrees of freedom ({CDOF}). There appears to be no simple procedure to compute {CDOF}, the maximum number of flows that can be manipulated simultaneously, especially in the context of plant-wide control ({PWC}) of industrial processes. Hence, a simple and yet effective procedure to find {CDOF} is proposed and illustrated in this work. The key idea is to define ‘restraining number’ (i.e., the minimum number of flows that cannot be manipulated along with others in an unit, which is also an inherent characteristic of that unit) of an unit. We show that the restraining number is equal to the number of independent and overall material balances with no associated inventory11Inventory is used here to refer to ‘variable hold-up’ but not ‘fixed hold-up’. For example, gas phase (or gas–liquid phase) {PFR} is considered as the ‘unit with inventory’ as it contains ‘variable hold-up’ and liquid phase {PFR} is considered as the ‘unit without inventory’ as it contains ‘fixed hold-up’. in that particular unit. The concept of restraining number is then used to find {CDOF} of not only simple units but also highly integrated processes. One of the advantages is its generic nature, which facilitates its automation. Moreover, the proposed procedure implicitly takes care of number of phases and components involved in the unit. In addition, it needs just the basic understanding of simple units and one does not require all the mathematical equations involved.},

The macroscopic thermally conductive {SiC} material could be efficiently employed as a support for controlling the active phase, i.e. metal and zeolite, and anchoring the powder-foam nanocarbons in the field of catalysis. In light of the results, one can state that silicon carbide foam could be regarded as an ideal alternative support, which provides a great enhancement of both the catalytic performance and the catalytic stability compared to that of the traditional catalysts, in several gas- and liquid-phase catalytic processes.},

Technologies such as anaerobic membrane reactors ({AnMBRs}) can perform anaerobic digestion at lower {HRTs} while maintaining high chemical oxygen demand ({COD}) removal efficiencies. This study evaluated the effect of {HRT} and organic loading rate ({OLR}) on the stability and performance of a side-stream {AnMBR} in treating diluted fresh food waste ({FW}). The reactor was fed with synthetic {FW} at an influent concentration of 8.24 (± 0.12) g {COD}/L. The {OLR} was increased by reducing the {HRT} from 20 d to 1 d. The {AnMBR} obtained an overall removal efficiency of \&gt; 97\% and \&gt; 98\% of the influent {COD} and total suspended solids ({TSS}), respectively, throughout the course of operation. The biological process was able to convert 76\% of the influent {COD} into biogas with 70\% methane content, while the cake layer formed on the membrane gave an additional {COD} removal of 7\%. Total ammoniacal nitrogen ({TAN}) and total nitrogen ({TN}) concentrations were found to be higher in the bioreactor than in the influent, and average overall removal efficiencies of 17.3 (± 5) \% and 61.5 (± 3) \% of {TAN} and {TN}, respectively, were observed with respect to the bioreactor concentrations after 2 weeks. Total phosphorus ({TP}) had an average removal efficiency of 40.39 (± 5) \% with respect to the influent. Membrane fouling was observed when the {HRT} was decreased from 7 to 5 d and was alleviated through backwashing. This study suggests that the side-stream {AnMBR} can be used to successfully reduce the typical {HRT} of wet anaerobic food waste (solids content 7\%) digesters from 20 days to 1 day, while maintaining a high {COD} removal efficiency and biogas production.},

The model considers the effects of fluid flow, changes of physical properties, heat and mass transfer by conduction and convection, interphase gradients and reactant consumption by an exothermic irreversible first-order reaction with Arrhenius kinetics. The one-dimensional model is analyzed in detail using singularity theory. Linear instability theory is used to determine the boundary of the region of parameters at which the uniform down-flow loses stability, and it is shown that flow maldistributions are possible for typical operating conditions. Bifurcation theory, numerical spectral and continuation methods are combined to determine the different types of nonuniform flow patterns and corresponding temperature and concentration fields. Unlike the pseudohomogeneous model where the maximum exit temperature cannot exceed the adiabatic temperature rise (Pem → ∞), the heterogeneous model can have isolated high temperature branches that exist when particle Lewis number is less than unity. It is shown that this maximum temperature on the isolated branch can be as high as β/Le where β is the adiabatic temperature rise {andLe} is the particle Lewis number (Le {\textless} 1.0). Finally, a possible mechanism for the formation of the localized hot spots observed in commercial reactors is proposed; the interphase resistances cause the existence of very high temperature isolated steady-state branches which are attained by the catalyst particles when maldistributed flows occur.},

It was found that the regions where conversion can be calculated from simplified mass transfer models are not discriminated by common results for entrance-length. We also illustrate the trade-offs that exist across this operating map concerning the catalyst design (costs associated with loading and volume) and overall system performance (evaluated in terms of reactant conversion, flow efficiency and microreactor effectiveness).

	abstract = {Hydraulic wash columns are well suited for solid–liquid separation and ultrapurification in melt-suspension crystallization. For steady operation of a hydraulic wash column and proper purification, the length of the crystal bed and position of the wash front should stay within safe limits, which requires a well-defined control system. To understand the interactions between slurry properties, column dimensions, and process conditions, a dynamic model was developed. The model was validated with help of experiments in a pilot-plant wash column, fed from a continuous crystallizer. P-Xylene was used as the model compound. It satisfactorily predicted the trends in the length of the crystal bed and the wash front height, and the interactions in the wash column are largely understood. With the help of the model a feedback control system with two control loops was designed and simulated. For a wide range of crystal fractions (0.05 to 0.3 v/v) in the feed stream, both the length of the bed and the wash front were kept at the desired setpoint values, indicating the flexibility of a controlled wash column.},

The role of operating factors viz., H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}O{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} concentration (0.12 × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} moles/L to 3 moles/L), [H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}O{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}]/[Fe{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}] molar ratio (2 to 75), and reaction time (30 to 200 minutes), on {COD} removal was determined through a series of batch experiments conducted in acidic environment at room temperature. The experiments were conducted with 500 {mL} {PW} samples in 1L glass beakers covered on the outside with aluminum foil to protect them from sunlight. Pre-decided amounts of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate ({FeSO}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}.7H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}O) and hydrogen peroxide (H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}O{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) were added to initiate the Fenton reaction.

	abstract = {An experiment on Fenton degradation of sugarcane vinasse was carried out to determine its effect on the wastewater characteristics. Vinasse, a by-product of distillation in the bioethanol industry, contains high organic matter, as the value of chemical oxygen demand ({COD}) is \&gt;100,000 mg/L and {BOD}5 is 31,250 mg/L. The Fenton reaction is one of the advanced oxidation process ({AOP}) methods which has been widely applied for the treatment of wastewater containing organic pollutants and contaminants. This method utilizes hydroxyl radical (\&bull;{OH}) produced from the catalyzing reaction between Fe2+ or Fe3+ and hydrogen peroxide. The effect of {pH}, the ratio of [H2O2] and [{COD}], and the ratio of [H2O2] to [Fe3+] were studied in this research to evaluate the Fenton reaction. Results from this experiment showed that treatment of vinasse using the Fenton reaction decreased the {COD} value to 48.10\%, and its biodegradability enhanced almost two times at a {pH} value of 3.8, a ratio of [H2O2] to [{COD}] of 0.62, and a ratio of [H2O2] to [Fe3+] of 50 (g/g), which demonstrated that the Fenton treatment was effective to reduce organic matter of sugarcane vinasse. Three kinetic models (first order, second order, and Behnajad\&ndash;Modirshahla\&ndash;Ghanbery ({BMG}) kinetic model) were used to evaluate the degradation of the {COD} value. On the basis of the value of R2 (coefficient of determination), we suggested that {BMG} represented the best kinetic model. This study finds that the Fenton treatment is able to mitigate the environmental impacts of sugarcane vinasse.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses the interpretation of measurements in experimental catalysis. It focuses on the most frequent problem in the study of heterogeneous catalysis—that is, the determination of a quantity called “catalyst activity,” the experimental procedures, and methods of interpretation leading to a proper description of this quantity. Catalyst activity manifests itself in terms of a chemical reaction rate characteristic of the presence of the catalyst. It is always such a reaction velocity that is the subject of primary experimental data from which a description of the catalyst's activity must be derived. The reaction velocity under any particular operating condition may well be affected by a variety of more or less independent variables. For example, in many fundamental researches, relationships are sought with the composition, crystal lattice, and electronic structure of the catalyst solid, yet measured reaction velocities are often influenced by gas transport phenomena that are unrelated to any of these fundamental properties. Gas transport phenomena and diffusion effects have been described occasionally in the literature. The powerful role played by these in determining the nature of experimental data cannot be overemphasized. The chapter discusses the behavior of catalysts related to the design and the interpretation of catalytic experiments in the course of fundamental research.},

Equilibrium adsorption capacities of pure {CH}4 and pure N2 were determined by these dynamic experiments and Langmuir isotherm models were regressed to these pure fluid data over the ranges of temperature and pressure measured. A linear driving force-based model of adsorption in a fixed bed was developed to extract the mass transfer coefficients ({MTCs}) for {CH}4 and N2 from the pure gas experimental data. The {MTCs} determined from single adsorbate experiments were used to successfully predict the component breakthroughs for experiments with equimolar {CH}4 + N2 gas mixtures in the {DCB} apparatus. The {MTC} of {CH}4 on H+-mordenite at 902 {kPa} was 0.013 s−1 at 302.9 K and 0.004 s−1 at 243.6 K. The {MTC} of N2 on H+-mordenite at 902 {kPa} was 0.011 s−1 at 302.9 K and 0.005 s−1 at 243.5 K. The values of the {MTCs} measured for each gas at a constant feed gas flow rate were observed to increase in a linear trend with the inverse of pressure. However, the apparent {MTCs} obtained at the lowest pressures studied (≈105 {kPa}) were systematically below this linear trend, because of the slightly longer residence time of helium in the mass spectrometer used to monitor effluent composition. Nevertheless, the pure fluid dynamic breakthrough data at these lowest pressures could still be reasonably well described using {MTC} values estimated from the linear trend. Furthermore, the results of dynamic breakthrough experiments with mixtures were all reliably predicted using the capacity and {MTC} correlations developed for the pure fluids.},

Methanol synthesis in multi-tubular reactors is evaluated using packed-bed and monolithic reactors by modeling heat and mass transfer in each reactor. The obtained simulation results show that, at low gas hourly space velocity ({GHSV} = 10,000 h−1), the performances of both reactor technologies are similar. In this case, the packed-bed reactor technology is the most appropriate technology due to its simplicity of installation and operation. At high {GHSV} (25,000 h−1), the packed-bed reactor technology is limited by a considerable pressure drop that causes an important loss in productivity due to thermodynamic equilibrium, whereas the monolithic reactors exhibit negligible pressure drop and achieve far better performances.},

	abstract = {In the late 1990’s, the “new-economy” industries in China proved to be relatively vulnerable and were strongly hit by the financial crisis in Asia. As a result, a new economic support policy was introduced in China’s Yangtze Delta region, which put greater emphasis on the support of traditional industrial sectors, including the chemical industry. This paper investigates the effects of the growth of this industry, as well as the potential and current problems emerging from new growth paths. It compares the growth of three newly developed chemical industry parks in Shanghai, Nanjing and Ningbo. The paper is based on an institutional perspective of clustering processes arguing that regional industrialization is subject to formal and informal institutions which shape the growth paths and contribute to divergent regional trajectories. Although these industrial parks all benefit from the general economic upswing in China, their development is influenced by different business models, economic contexts, goals and strategies, leaving room for divergence and specialization. Due to the existing structure of operations, these parks have a great deal of potential but also face substantial challenges, such as the establishment of internal networks and close customer linkages. It is argued that this might limit their innovative capability in the future. Furthermore, their growth prospects differ depending on future government policies.},

In this paper a comprehensive pseudo-homogenous model of a multi-tubular packed-bed reformer has been developed to investigate the impact of operating conditions and geometric parameters on its performance. A kinetic Langmuir-Hinshelwood model of the methanol steam reforming process was proposed. In addition to the kinetic model, the pressure drop and the mass and heat transfer phenomena along the reactor were taken into account. This model was verified by a dynamic model in the platform of {ASPEN}. The diffusion effect inside catalyst particles was also estimated and accounted for by the effectiveness factor. The simulation results showed axial temperature profiles in both tube and shell side with different operating conditions. Moreover, the lower flow rate of liquid fuel and higher inlet temperature of thermal air led to a lower concentration of residual methanol, but also a higher concentration of generated {CO} from the reformer exit. The choices of operating conditions were limited to ensure a tolerable concentration of methanol and {CO} in H2-rich gas for feeding into a high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell ({HT}-{PEMFC}) stack. With fixed catalyst load, the increase of tube number and decrease of tube diameter improved the methanol conversion, but also increased the {CO} concentration in reformed gas. In addition, increasing the number of baffle plates in the shell side increased the methanol conversion and the {CO} concentration.},

Additive manufacturing of the metal mixer scaffold results in maximum design flexibility and is compatible with deposition methods such as metal cold spraying which allow for mass production and linear process scale up. High to full conversion was achieved for the majority of substrates, demonstrating the flexibility and versatility of the catalytic static mixer technology.

	abstract = {Chemical companies are constantly seeking new, high-margin growth opportunities, the majority of which lie in high-grade, specialty chemicals, rather than in the bulk sector. To realize these opportunities, manufacturers are increasingly considering decentralized, flexible production facilities: large-scale production units are uneconomical for innovative products with a short lifespan and volatile markets. Small modular plants have low financial risks, are flexible and can respond rapidly to changes in demand. Logistics costs can be also reduced by moving production closer to customers and/or sources of raw materials. Moreover, stricter safety regulations can in many cases be more easily met using smaller distributed facilities. Modularization of chemical production can thus have potentially significant economic and safety benefits. In this article, several drivers for modular production are reviewed, and modular production architectures are evaluated based on a new metric, the value density of feedstock resources and markets for the products of a process. The links between modularization and process intensification are also discussed. Several industrial examples are provided and used to highlight challenges and future directions for this area. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers {AIChE} J, 63: 4262–4272, 2017},

	abstract = {Zeolite beta allows high yields and good selectivity in the batch nitration of toluene and chlorobenzene with acetyl nitrate. Deactivation of the {HPB}1 zeolite beta catalyst takes place due to dealumination and the adsorption of acetic acid and acetic acid anhydride, which causes a decrease of the selectivity to 4-nitrotoluene in the nitration of toluene. Active reaction centres for the nitration are protonated aluminium centres in the zeolite framework, but not free aluminium species inside the reaction mixture. Nitrate or counter ions like sodium are not involved in the reaction mechanism. In the continuous liquid-phase nitration with acetyl nitrate, the zeolite beta catalyst enhanced the conversion of toluene only slightly, compared to the non-catalysed homogeneous reaction. With the less reactive substrate chlorobenzene, however, zeolite beta acted as an efficient catalyst in the continuous nitration with acetyl nitrate.},

	abstract = {A thermodynamic analysis of the nitrogen-water system for {BWR} operating conditions assesses the chemical species responsible for steam line radiation increases. Nitrogen (N2) was the important gaseous form during hydrogen injection into {BWR} feedwater. The potential-{pH} diagram for the system Fe-Cr-H2O was derived from thermodynamic information for {BWR} operating temperatures. The diagram shows that a mixed oxide ({FeCr}2O4) is stable under the reducing conditions imposed by hydrogen water chemistry ({HWC}) for {BWR} while the simple oxide Fe2O3 is stable for the more oxidizing conditions of normal water chemistry. The presence of Cr in the oxide may account for the mitigation of intergranular stress corrosion cracking of sensitized stainless steel during {HWC}.},
