	abstract = {Continuous-flow synthesis of the selective herbicide pendimethalin was demonstrated in both a laboratory-scale and a pilot-scale reactor using only concentrated nitric acid as nitrating agent. The di-nitration reaction follows second-order kinetics where the reaction is first order with respect to both reactant and nitric acid. The pinched-tube reactor was chosen for pilot-scale reactor fabrication due to its excellent mixing and mass transfer characteristics compared to a straighttube reactor. The estimated mass transfer coefficient showed similar nature in the laboratory-scale and the pilot-scale pinched-tube reactor, ensuring similar performance at the pilot scale. Di-nitration in continuous flow, inline quenching, extraction, and phase separation are some of the salient features of the developed pilot plant. The importance of the start-up time for achieving steady state in the flow system at the large scale is highlighted.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the nitration of 2,4-dinitrotoluene ({DNT}) and its conversion to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene ({TNT}) at a gram scale with the use of a fully automated ﬂow chemistry system. The conversion of {DNT} to {TNT} traditionally requires the use of highly hazardous reagents like fuming sulfuric acid (oleum), fuming nitric acid (90–100\%), and elevated temperatures. Flow chemistry oﬀers advantages compared to conventional syntheses including a high degree of safety and simpler multistep automation. The conﬁguration and development of this automated process based on a commercially available ﬂow chemistry system is described. A high conversion rate ({\textgreater}99\%) was achieved. Unlike established synthetic methods, ordinary nitrating mixture (65\% {HNO}3/98\% H2SO4) and shorter reaction times (10–30 min) were applied. The viability of ﬂow nitration as a means of safe and continuous synthesis of {TNT} was investigated. The method was optimized using an experimental design approach, and the resulting process is safer, faster, and more eﬃcient than previously reported {TNT} synthesis procedures. We compared the ﬂow chemistry and batch approaches, including a provisional cost calculation for laboratory-scale production (a thorough economic analysis is, however, beyond the scope of this article). The method is considered ﬁt for purpose for the safe production of high-purity explosives standards at a gram scale, which are used to verify that the performance of explosive trace detection equipment complies with {EU} regulatory requirements.},

Such reactions often cause time delays to the delivery of larger batches of intermediates or ﬁnal compounds for medicinal chemistry projects, because considerable time is required for safety evaluation and, if necessary, modiﬁcation of the procedure so that it can be scaled-up and run in a safe manner. A commercially available continuous ﬂow reactor was used in the scale up of three challenging nitrations including a reaction involving a potentially explosive mixture of acetic acid and fuming nitric acid, with a productivity of 97 g/h.},
