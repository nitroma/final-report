	abstract = {The Analytic Hierarchy Process ({AHP}) is widely used method in multiple-attribute decision making. In the recent literature many authors used different judgment scales which influenced the results and decisions. In this paper the author reviews and discusses effects of utilization of various judgment scales on priority estimation in {AHP}. There has been studies that have been concerned with the comparison of judgment scales but there were no studies concerned with consistency measures that are needed. The goal of this paper is to compare and discuss the application of various judgment scales on the results in particular practical example that has been used in previous paper by Saaty (2003). Thus the focus of the paper is to analyze the impact of using different judgment scales on the resulting priorities and consistency to default scale as proposed by Saaty. Results suggest that judgment scales have a profound impact on criteria priorities but not on ranking of criteria. However, the consistency varies among applied judgment scales. Authors calculated the values of random index needed for calculation of the consistency index in {AHP} for all concerned scales. Based on them the consistency index was computed and compared. Both consistent and inconsistent Saaty matrices were used for comparison.},

	abstract = {Often, data in multi-criteria decision making ({MCDM}) problems are imprecise and changeable. Therefore, an important step in many applications of {MCDM} is to perform a sensitivity analysis on the input data. This paper presents a methodology for performing a sensitivity analysis on the weights on the decision criteria and the performance values of the alternatives expressed in terms of the decision criteria. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on three widely used decision methods. These methods are the weighted sum model ({WSM}), the weighted product model ({WPM}), and the analytic hierarchy process ({AHP}). This paper formalizes a number of important issues on sensitivity analysis and derives some critical theoretical results. Also, a number of illustrative examples and computational experiments further illustrate the application of the proposed methodology.},

Electric vehicles may be considered the alternative-fuel vehicles with the lowest air pollution. Hybrid electric vehicles provide an alternate mode, at least for the period of improving the technology of electric vehicles. A hybrid electric vehicle is defined as a vehicle with the conventional internal combustion engine and an electric motor as its major sources of power. Experts from different decision-making groups performed the multiple attribute evaluation of alternative vehicles. {AHP} is applied to determine the relative weights of evaluation criteria. {TOPSIS} and {VIKOR} are compared and applied to determine the best compromise alternative fuel mode. The result shows that the hybrid electric bus is the most suitable substitute bus for Taiwan urban areas in the short and median term. But, if the cruising distance of the electric bus extends to an acceptable range, the pure electric bus could be the best alternative.},

	abstract = {Off-patent pharmaceuticals ({OPPs}) represent more than 60\% of the pharmaceutical market in many emerging countries, where they are frequently evaluated primarily on cost rather than with health technology assessment. {OPPs} are assumed to be identical to the originators. Branded and unbranded generic versions can, however, vary from the originator in active pharmaceutical ingredients, dosage, consistency formulation, excipients, manufacturing processes, and distribution, for example. These variables can alter the efficacy and safety of the product, negatively impacting both the anticipated cost savings and the population’s health. In addition, many health care systems lack the resources or expertise to evaluate such products, and current assessment methods can be complex and difficult to adapt to a health system’s needs. Multicriteria decision analysis ({MCDA}) simple scoring is an evidence-based health technology assessment methodology for evaluating {OPPs}, especially in emerging countries in which resources are limited but decision makers still must balance affordability with factors such as drug safety, level interchangeability, manufacturing site and active pharmaceutical ingredient quality, supply track record, and real-life outcomes. {MCDA} simple scoring can be applied to pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement, formulary listing, and drug procurement. In November 2015, a workshop was held at the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Annual Meeting in Milan to refine and prioritize criteria that can be used in {MCDA} simple scoring for {OPPs}, resulting in an example {MCDA} process and 22 prioritized criteria that health care systems in emerging countries can easily adapt to their own decision-making processes.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the chemical and pharmaceutical industries have faced increased development times and costs with fewer novel chemicals being discovered. This has resulted in many companies focusing on innovative research and development as they consider this key to business success. In particular, a number of leading industrial organisations have adopted the principles of Whole Process Design ({WPD}). {WPD} considers the optimisation of the entire product development process, from raw materials to end product, rather than focusing on each individual unit operation. The complexity involved in the implementation of {WPD} requires rationalised decision-making, often with limited or uncertain information. This thesis assesses the most widely applied methods in Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis ({MCDA}) in conjunction with the results of two interviews and two questionnaires that identified the industrial requirements for decision-making during {WPD}. From the findings of this work, a novel decision-making methodology was proposed, the outcome of which allows a decision-maker to visually interpret their decision results with associated levels of uncertainty. To validate the proposed methodology, a software framework was developed that incorporates two other decision-making approaches, the Analytical Hierarchy Process ({AHP}) and {ELimination} Et Choix Traduisant la {REalité} trois ({ELECTRE} {III}). The framework was then applied to a number of industrial case studies to validate the application of the proposed methodology.},
