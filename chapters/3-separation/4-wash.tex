\section{Hydraulic wash column design}

 Initially, three types of wash column were considered: gravity, hydraulic and mechanical. The main disadvantage with using gravity wash column is the long residence time in hours. Whereas, hydraulic and mechanical columns have residence time of 10 to 15 minutes. Both hydraulic and mechanical columns are subject to compressive force and pressure drop. Due to the moving mechanical parts in the mechanical column it was a less desirable choice for this process. Hydraulic wash column was chosen to be suitable and it combines continuous solid-liquid separation with counter current washing. 

\subsection{Steady State Model}   

Typically, the design of a hydraulic wash column will be based on pilot-scale experiments to determine appropriate dimensions at varying operating conditions. In this case a  model from literature \cite{van_oord-knol_hydraulic_2000} was used to estimate the performance of the column at steady state. The hydraulic wash column was modelled based on volume and force balance using initial dimensions \cite{oordknol_dynamic_2002}. Some variables were used to observe the performance of the column handling the output from the MSMPR crystalliser. The aim of this model was to determine an appropriate steer flow rate, feasible column diameter and determine the pressure at different sections of the wash column in  order to attain a 99.9 \% pure p-NT product flow.  


Purification in the hydraulic column occurs through displacement and crystallisation of wash liquid on the crystals. TNO had developed a TNO HWC with purity greater than 99.9\% \cite{noauthor_melt_nodate}. Based on this, the model assumes 99.9 \% solid-liquid separation in the wash column with negligible amount of liquid in the product flow rate and in the wash front.  However, if impurities are entrapped in the crystal lattice during crystallisation, these will not be removed. This highlights the disadvantage of hydraulic wash column compared to gravity wash column. Gravity wash column allows some impurities to be removed from the crystals during the long residence time \cite{van_oord-knol_hydraulic_2000}.

Figure \ref{fig:hydraulic} illustrates the characteristics of the hydraulic column and the components required during operation. The feed slurry contains a mixture of mother liquor (m-NT and o-NT)  and solid crystals (p-NT) from the MSMPR crystalliser. This enters the column into the slurry section. Due to difference in density the solid crystals will fall down the column. As the crystals move down the column it forms a packed bed of solid. The filter in the filter tube removes the mother liquor from the filtration section. A part of the mother liquor gets recycled back into the column by the steer pump, known as steer flow and some mother liquor is purged out as residue flow. The pressure drop across the filter drives the solids down and the mother liquor up the filter tube. This is where solid-liquid separation takes place. The solid crystals form a densely packed moving bed in the wash front section with no mother liquor present. The rotating knife at the bottom will scrape the bottom of the packed bed so pure p-NT solids fall into the bottom section. The melter at the bottom melts the p-NT solids. Some of the molten solid gets purged out as product flow rate through the valve. Whilst, some p-NT gets recycled back into the bottom section. Due to the pressure drop at the valve, the washing liquid gets pushed up into the washing section of the column where counter current washing occurs. The solid crystals, which are at a lower temperature, causes the washing liquid to crystallise on the solid particles leading to a frozen wash front level. This counter current washing allows for 99.9 \% ultra purification. 

\subsubsection{Volume balance} 
This model was based on the assumption that the liquid and solid in the system were incompressible. For simplicity, density and viscosity were assumed to be independent of temperature. 

Overall volume balance at the top section  
\begin{equation}
\phi_{\mathrm{feed}}+\phi_{\mathrm{steer}}=\phi_{s,\mathrm{filters}}+\phi_{ml.\mathrm{filters}}
\end{equation}

The total length of the top section remains constant. The length of the filtration section was derived from the solid balance in the top section. 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\dd L_{\mathrm{filtration}}}{\dd t} = \frac{1}{A_c(1-\alpha_2-\epsilon)}(\alpha_1\phi_{\mathrm{feed}}-\phi_{s,\mathrm{filters}})
\end{equation}

In the bottom section, there is the stagnant zone with the crystals. Then there is the wash zone with only the crystal and the wash liquid at steady state. The wash liquid crystallises due to low temperature at the wash front. The crystallisation of the wash liquid can be related to the disappearance of the wash liquid by difference in density of the solid and liquid.
\begin{equation}
C_l= \frac{\rho_s}{\rho_l}C_s
\end{equation}

The amount of crystallised material was calculated based on a heat balance and temperature difference between the feed and the melt. This assumes the total cooling capacity of the crystals is used to crystallise the wash liquid. 
\begin{equation}
C_s= \frac{c_p(T_{\mathrm{melt}}-T_{\mathrm{feed}})}{\Delta H_m}Q_{s,\mathrm{filters}}
\end{equation}

The length of the wash section is related to the wash-liquid flow entering the knife and the wash liquid that crystallises. This assumes the wash liquid is not lost through the filters which is ensured by positioning the filters above the wash section.
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_w A_c \frac{\dd L_{\mathrm{wash}}}{\dd t}= \phi_{wl,\mathrm{knife}}-C_l
\end{equation}

The wash column during operation forms 3 layers of filtration, stagnant and wash sections. Within the filtration and stagnant section it is assumed the porosity and permeability remain constant. Since the crystals form a densely packed column $\epsilon$ was approximated at 0.45 \cite{jansens_furification_1995}. Due to the wash-liquid crystallisation at the wash zone an abrupt change in porosity and permeability was considered. The consolidation of the crystal bed were neglected in this model, however under compressive force from the pressure at the top section this may not be a valid assumption and will have to be explored further through experiments. The porosity in the wash zone was calculated from the equation below. 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{w}= \epsilon-(1-\epsilon)\left(\frac{c_p(T_{\mathrm{melt}}-T_{\mathrm{feed}})}{\Delta H_m}\right)
\end{equation}

At steady state, the wash section is constant with no flow of mother liquor into or out of the bottom section. The mother liquor at the top section leaves the column through the filter and splits into residual and steer flow. 
\begin{equation}
\phi_{\mathrm{residue}}= \phi_{ml,\mathrm{filters}} - \phi_{\mathrm{steer}}
\end{equation}

The volume balance at the melting circuit is based on the assumption that crystals are molten the moment they enter the melting circuit. The wash liquid enters the column at the melting temperature. 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\rho_s}{\rho_l}\phi_{s,\mathrm{knife}}= \phi_{wl,\mathrm{knife}} - \phi_{\mathrm{product}}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Force balance}
The liquid pressure drop across each section were calculated with the following modified Darcy's law equation. 
\begin{align}
    \frac{\Delta P_{l,\mathrm{filtration}}}{L_{\mathrm{filtration}}} &= \frac{\epsilon \eta_{l}}{B_{\mathrm{filtration}}}\left(\frac{\phi_{ml,\mathrm{filters}}}{\epsilon A_c} - \frac{\phi_{s,\mathrm{filters}}}{1-\epsilon A_c}\right) \\
    \frac{\Delta P_{l,\mathrm{stagnant}}}{L_{\mathrm{stagnant}}} &= \frac{\epsilon \eta_{l}}{B_{\mathrm{stagnant}}}\left(-\frac{\phi_{ml,\mathrm{bottom}}}{\epsilon A_c} - \frac{\phi_{s,\mathrm{filters}}}{1-\epsilon A_c}\right) \\
    \frac{\Delta P_{l,\mathrm{wash}}}{L_{\mathrm{wash}}} &= \frac{\epsilon \eta_{l}}{B_{\mathrm{wash}}}\left(-\frac{\phi_{wl,\mathrm{knife}}}{\epsilon_w A_c} - \frac{\phi_{s,\mathrm{knife}}}{1-\epsilon_w A_c}\right)
\end{align}

The liquid pressure gradient at each section were assumed to be constant since the packed bed is considered incompressible. The liquid pressure at the top in the slurry section was based on the pressure at the filter and the pressure drop over the filtration section. 
\begin{equation}
P_{\mathrm{top}} = P_{\mathrm{filters}} + \Delta P_{l,\mathrm{filtration}}
\end{equation}

The pressure at the bottom is equal to the pressure drop in the valve of the melting circuit. This pressure drop across the valve is determined through a linear relation with the product flow rate.
\begin{equation}
P_{\mathrm{bottom}}=\Delta P_{\mathrm{valve}} = K_w\phi_{\mathrm{product}}
\end{equation}

The pressure in the melting circuit was calculated using the equation below. 
\begin{equation}
\Delta P_{\mathrm{valve}} = \Delta P_{l,\mathrm{stagnant}} + \Delta P_{l,\mathrm{wash}} + P_{\mathrm{filters}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Results and Discussion}
The linear system of equations from the steady state model were solved using input variables and parameters shown in Table \ref{tab:inputsparameters}.

During operation of the hydraulic column  variations in the length of the filtration, stagnant and wash section is possible. Therefore, simulations of variable filtration and wash section lengths were implemented on Excel to determine the effect on pressures at different sections of the column. With proper controls in place, the sections should not vary significantly during normal operation, therefore variation in filtration and wash section would be designed to be between 0.27 to 0.30 m.  
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.5\linewidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{chapters/3-separation/figures/diameter.jpg}
\caption{Effect of varying diameter}
\label{fig:dia_col}
\end{wrapfigure}

The length of the column was fixed at 0.8 m. The diameter of the column was varied from 0.1 m to 0.3 m to observe the impact it has on the pressure across the column. Figure \ref{fig:dia_col} indicates when the diameter is less than 0.165 m the model suggests negative pressure at the filter which could imply instead of mother liquor flowing upwards through the filter tube, it could be flowing in the reverse direction. The pressure at the top is also negative indicating at these conditions the fluid flow in the column may not be in the desirable downward direction. A suitable diameter was chosen at 0.17 m allowing for slight variations in the section lengths over time under normal operation.

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.5\linewidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{chapters/3-separation/figures/steerflow.jpg}
\caption{Effect of varying steer flow rate}
\label{fig:steer_col}
\end{wrapfigure}

Steer flow is the flow rate of the mother liquor being recycled back into the column from the filter tubes whilst some mother liquor are removed as residual flow. The filtrate being recycled back into the column increases the transport force. Steer flowrate was varied from 1.5e-5 to 3.5e-5 $m^{3}/s$. Figure \ref{fig:steer_col} shows the unfeasible and feasible region of operation. Above a steer flow rate of 2.7e-5 $m^{3}/s$, the model shows negative liquid pressure drop at the filter. However, at lower steer flow such as 1.5e-5 $m^{3}/s$ the filter pressure increases significantly to more than 10 bar. In order to attain a lower pressure but also ensure the column is operating in a feasible region, the steer flow rate at 2.65 e-5 $m^{3}/s$ was chosen. At this flow rate there is an allowance for variation in the flowrate whilst the column is still operating in the feasible region. The steer flow appears to have no impact on the bottom pressure and the top pressure. This is because the bottom pressure relies on the valve resistance coefficient. 

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.5\linewidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{chapters/3-separation/figures/kozeny.jpg}
\caption{Effect of varying Kozeny constant}
\label{fig:koz_col}
\end{wrapfigure}

The permeability constant, B, was determined using Kozeny constant, K".  In this process, K" was considered to be 5, assuming the crystal is spherical. A sensitivity analysis on the permeability constant was conducted by varying K".Figure \ref{fig:koz_col} shows when K">6.5, the design becomes infeasible reaching negative filter pressures.The sensitivity analysis was conducted with the filtration and wash section varying between 0.27 and 0.3 m to observe the range of pressure in the column. It is evident, the hydraulic column is sensitive to the Kozenzy constant and the permeability of the packed bed. This was expected due to the inverse relationship between the permeability constant and pressure drop in the modified Darcy's law equation. It is essential to conduct pilot-scale experiments to obtain more accurate value for K" and the permeability constant to get a reliable observation of the column's performance. 

Based on literature \cite{jansens_furification_1995} the temperature profile at the wash front was found to be independent of the axial and radial position in the column if the distance of the wash front from the filter is greater than 0.1 m. In this design the filter tube was positioned 0.1 m above the wash front. The temperature profile was also found to be independent of the product throughput. Additionally, compressive stress impacts the permeability of the bed and causes deformation of the crystal particles. In this process the crystals are melted; the crystal particle size or shape was not of concern so compressive stress was not considered. 

\subsection{Materials Choice}
- material for the column itself 

\subsection{Mechanical Design}
-BS standard has to be followed since column maximum operating pressure is 7.36 bar. It is a pressure vessel.  

The minimum thickness for a cylindrical shell, $e_{\mathrm{cyl}}$, can be computed as 

\begin{equation}
    e_{\mathrm{cyl}} = \frac{p D_i}{2f - p}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $p$ is the design pressure of the vessel, and $D_i$ is the internal diameter of the vessel taken to be the same as $D$ as defined in Section \ref{sec: crystalliser mass balance}. For a vessel with ellipsoidal ends, the minimum thickness, $e_{\mathrm{end}}$, can be calculated using the methodology outlined in Section 3.5.2 of \textbf{BS5500: 1997}. The values of $e_{\mathrm{cyl}}$ and $e_{\mathrm{end}}$ have been obtained as 0.36 mm and 0.918 mm. After a corrosion factor of 1.5 mm has been taken, a uniform wall thickness of 3 mm has been chosen for both the shell and the dome ends. 

Pipes with nominal pipe size (NPS) of 2 inch have been selected for all ports on the crystalliser vessel. 





\subsection{Conclusion and Recommendations}

Crystallisation was used in this separation due the large difference in melting temperatures of the nitro toluene isomers (mainly para and meta) and the requirement for a high purity, high recovery separation step. The crystallisation gave a 90.6\% recovery of PNT solids from the liquid feed mixture. 



On the issue of fouling, removal mechanisms such as mechanical devices (hammers, scrapers) or chemical removal like the introduction of a solution to dissolve the encrusted layer. Preferbaly, the removal would be on line to not incur shutdown costs and reduce production, but if necessary, off line technqiues could be used.
Moving forward, pilot studies can be carried out to determine accurate coefficients for crystallisation in both primary and secondary nucleation rather than using the approximate values for similar systems.
