\section{Introduction}

This report explains the design for the separation of p-nitrotoluene (PNT) from a liquid stream consisting predominantly of PNT and m-nitrotoluene (MNT) with a trace amount of o-nitrotoluene (ONT). Since the production of 4-aminobenzaldehyde (4-ABH) and 4-aminobenzoic acid (4-ABA), the final products of Nitroma's nitration plant, requires PNT as the precursor with at least 90\% purity, this separation holds a great significance and must be carefully considered and designed. Table \ref{tab:inlet crystalliser} summarises the inlet conditions at stream 1-12 on the overall PFD for this separation.
