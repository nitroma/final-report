\section{Introduction}

This report explains the design for the separation of p-nitrotoluene (p-NT) from m-nitrotoluene (m-NT) and a trace of o-nitrotoluene (o-NT). p-NT is required to have a purity greater than 90 \% since it is used as precursors to the final products. A MSMPR crystalliser and hydraulic wash column were chosen as appropriate separators. Both units were modelled to determine appropriate dimensions and evaluate the performance of the units. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on variables with uncertainty to demonstrate the effect it has on the designs and the output. Finally, mechanical designs with supplementary CAD drawings of both units are included.
