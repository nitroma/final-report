\section{Introduction}

This report explains the design of a MSMPR crystalliser and a hydraulic wash column for the separation of p-nitrotoluene (p-NT) from m-nitrotoluene (m-NT) and o-nitrotoluene (o-NT). The purity requirement for p-NT was greater than 90 \%. Both units were modelled and appropriate dimensions were determined. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on variables with uncertainty to demonstrate the effect it has on the designs. Finally, mechanical designs with supplementary CAD drawings were included.
