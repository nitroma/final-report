\section{Conclusions}\label{separation conclusions}

A separation system has been designed for separating PNT from a mixture of PNT, MNT, and trace of ONT. Crystallisation has been selected as the technique to achieve this separation due to the good difference between the melting points of PNT from MNT and ONT. Distillation, absorption, and adsorption have been deemed inappropriate and hence not selected. The system consists of a MSMPR suspension melt crystalliser, where PNT crystallises as solid, and a hydraulic wash column, where the PNT crystals are separated from the mother liquor and recovered as liquid. 

Pilot-scale studies are recommended to be carried out for a more detailed understanding and specification of the thermophysical processes relevant to the design. The rates of nucleation and growth for crystallisation of PNT from mixture of
