\section{Conclusions}\label{separation conclusions}

A separation system has been designed for separating PNT from a mixture of PNT, MNT, and trace of ONT. Crystallisation has been selected has the technique to achieve this separation due  A MSMPR melt crystalliser has been designed for the crystallisation of PNT from a mixture of PNT, MNT, and trace amount of ONT. Techniques including distillation,
