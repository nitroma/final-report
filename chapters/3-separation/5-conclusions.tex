\section{Conclusions}\label{separation conclusions}

A separation system has been designed for separating PNT from a mixture of PNT, MNT, and trace of ONT. Crystallisation has been selected as the technique to achieve this separation due to the good difference between the melting points of PNT from MNT and ONT. Distillation, absorption, and adsorption have been deemed inappropriate and hence not selected. The system consists of MSMPR suspension melt crystalliser has been designed for the crystallisation of PNT from a mixture of PNT, MNT, and trace amount of ONT. Techniques including distillation,
