\section{Introduction}


\section{Choice of separator}
The separation of p-nitrotoluene from m-nitrotoluene was designed in detail. P-nitrotoluene is an essential precursor to aminobenzaldehyde and aminobenzoic acid therefore it needs to be purified to at least --- \%. Due to the small difference in boiling points between p-NT and m-NT distillation was infeasible, it is also an energy intensive process. Similar solubility between the two components made the use of absorption or adsorption processes to be infeasible as well. However, crystallisers were deemed feasible due to the difference in melting points.

Melt crystallisers are particularly used for organic chemicals with favourable melting points. Compared to solution crystallisers, the growth rate in melt crystalliser is relatively fast and still leads to high purity products making it economically favourable. It also avoids the possibility  of thermal degradation  due to high temperature (1). From environmental perspective, solution crystallisation involves the addition of solvent that is usually treated as impurity. Whereas, melt crystallisation does not require any additional substances. Melt crystalliser also known to be relatively cheaper - need to find cost info if possible.

Types of melt crystalliser
Solid layer crystalliser:
advantages: avoid encrustation issue
disadvantages: higher investment costs, multistage process, not commonly used as continuous process

Suspension crystalliser:
advantages: moderate crystal growth and large surface areas, high purity product, continuous operation mode.
disadvantages: slurry handling,extras washing step required for solid-liquid separation, moving parts (1). 

Nitromaâ€™s plant aims to operate continuously. Suspension crystalliser was more suitable than solid-layer crystalliser. A novel crystalliser known as scraped surface heat exchanger (SSHE) was chosen. It operates continuously by producing a slurry of p-nitrotoluene crystals and m-nitrotoluene liquid which will be further separated in a hydraulic wash column to attain purified molten p-nitrotoluene.

\section{Hydraulic wash column design}

Commonly used solid-liquid separators are not continuous processes, typically batch or semi-batch. Wash column does wash and continuous transport in one process. Whereas, for example a centrifuge would require  melting the crystals and a means of solid transport by conveyor belt. Different type of wash columns include gravity, hydraulic and mechanical. Hydraulic was chosen because of shorter residence time and less moving mechanical parts. 

\subsection{Steady State Model}
Generally, the design of a hydraulic wash column will be based on pilot-scale experiments to determine appropriate dimensions at varying operating conditions. Instead, a dynamic model from literature --- was used to estimate the performance of the column. The hydraulic wash column was modelled based on volume and force balance using initial dimensions from ---. Following this method, the initial dimensions were varied to determine the performance of the column as key variables were varied.  

The model 100 \% solid-liquid separation in the wash column therefore no presence of liquid in the product flow rate since mother liquor will not enter the wash front. However, if impurities are entrapped in the crystal lattice during crystallisation, these will not be removed. This highlights the disadvantage of hydraulic wash column compared to gravity wash column. Gravity wash column allows some impurities to be removed from the crystals during the long residence time. 

The steady state model for the hydraulic wash column was formulated based on the following assumptions:
** a diagram of the wash column
\\ 1) The column is filled with incompressible liquid and crystals. 
\\ 2) Viscosity of the liquids are temperature independent for simplicity. 
\\ 3) Pressure drop across the wash column was based on a one-directional flow assumption. This is justified by the relatively large surface area of the filter to the cross-sectional area of the column. 
\\ 4) Porosity and permeability in each of the defined sections are constant hence consolidation of the bed is neglected. Since the production rate from this wash column is at the same order of magnitude as the one used in the literature, the applicability of the model is valid. 
\\ 5) The column is adiabatic above the knife.
\\ 6) Melting circuit provides just enough heat to melt all the crystals, hence the wash liquid re-entering the column is at the melt temperature. 

\textbf{Volume balance} 
\\Overall volume balance at the top section 
\begin{equation}
\phi_{feed}+\phi_{steer}=\phi_{s,filters}+\phi_{ml.filters}
\end{equation}

The total length of the top section is constant. The length of the filtration section was derived from the solid balance in the top section. 

\begin{equation}
\frac{dL_{filtration}}{dt} = \frac{1}{A_c(1-\alpha_2-\epsilon)}(\alpha_1\phi_{feed}-\phi_{s,filters})
\end{equation}

In the bottom section, there is the stagnant zone with the crystals. Then there is the wash zone with only the crystal and the wash liquid at steady state. The wash liquid crystallises due to the low temperature at the wash front. The crystallisation of the wash liquid can be related to the disappearance of the wash liquid by difference in density of the solid and liquid.

\begin{equation}
C_l= \frac{\rho_s}{\rho_l}C_s
\end{equation}

The amount of crystallised material was calculated based on a heat balance and temperature difference between the feed and the melt. This assumes the total cooling capacity of the crystals is used to crystallise the wash liquid. 

\begin{equation}
C_s= \frac{c_p(T_{melt}-T_{feed})}{\delta H_m}Q_{s,filters}
\end{equation}

The length of the wash section is related to the wash-liquid flow entering the knife and the wash liquid that crystallises. This assumes the wash liquid is not loss through the filters which is ensured by positioning the filters above the wash section.

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_w A_c \frac{dL_{wash}}{dt}= \phi_{wl,knife}-C_l
\end{equation}

At steady state, the wash section is constant therefore there is no flow of mother liquor into or out of the bottom section. The mother liquor at the top section leaves the column through the filter and split into residual and steer flow. 

\begin{equation}
\phi_{residue}= \phi_{ml,filters} - \phi_{steer}
\end{equation}

The volume balance at the melting circuit is based on the assumption that crystals are molten at the moment they enter the melting circuit. 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\rho_s}{\rho_l}\phi_{s,knife}= \phi_{wl,knife} - \phi_{product}
\end{equation}
