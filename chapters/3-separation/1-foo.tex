\section{Hydraulic wash column design}
Why hydraulic column?
Commonly used solid-liquid separators are not continuous processes, typically batch or semi-batch. Wash column does wash and continuous transport in one process. Whereas, for example a centrifuge would require  melting the crystals and a means of solid transport by conveyor belt. Different type of wash columns include gravity, hydraulic and mechanical. Hydraulic was chosen because of shorter residence time and less moving mechanical parts. 

\subsection{Modelling}
Inputs and parameters. 



\subsection{Results}
Length of bed, height, diameter, number of filter tubes etc. Observing the effect of key variables. Length of filtration and wash column - ensuring wash column stays below the filter. Pressure drop across the column
