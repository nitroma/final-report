\section{Hydraulic wash column design}
Why hydraulic column?
Commonly used solid-liquid separators are not continuous processes, typically batch or semi-batch. Wash column does wash and continuous transport in one process. Whereas, for example a centrifuge would require  melting the crystals and a means of solid transport by conveyor belt. Different type of wash columns include gravity, hydraulic and mechanical. Hydraulic was chosen because of shorter residence time and less moving mechanical parts. 

\subsection{Modelling}
Inputs and parameters. 
Assumes 100 \% solid-liquid separation in the wash column t since mother liquor will not enter the wash front. However, if impurities are entrapped in the crystal lattice during crystallisation, these will not be removed. This highlights the disadvantage of hydraulic wash column compared to gravity wash column. Gravity wash column ensures impurities are removed from the crystals during the long residence time. 


\subsection{Results}
Length of bed, height, diameter, number of filter tubes etc. Observing the effect of key variables. Length of filtration and wash column - ensuring wash column stays below the filter. Pressure drop across the column
