\section{Choice of separator}
Crystalliser with hydraulic wash column 



\section{Crystalliser design}




\section{Hydraulic wash column design}
Why hydraulic column?
Centrifuge is not continuous. Wash column does wash and continuous transport in one process. Whereas for centrifuge it would  melting the crystals and a means of solid transport by rotary drum. Different type of wash columns includeHydraulic because of low residence time and less moving mechanical parts. 

\subsection{Modelling}
Inputs and parameters. 



\subsection{Results}
Length of bed, height, diameter, number of tubes etc. Observing the effect of key variables. Length of filtration and wash column - ensuring wash column stays below the filter. Pressure drop across the column
