\section{Choice of separator}
The separation of p-nitrotoluene (p-NT) from m-nitrotoluene (m-NT) and a trace of o-nitrotoluene (o-NT) has been chosen to be designed in detail. p-NT is an essential precursor to aminobenzaldehyde and aminobenzoic acid, and it needs to be purified to at least 90 \%. Due to the small difference in boiling points between p-NT and the impurities, distillation is infeasible and energy intensive. Similar solubility between the two components made the use of absorption or adsorption processes infeasible as well. However, crystallisers were feasible due to the difference in melting points between p-NT and m-NT.

Crystallisation can produce high purity products with very low energy input compared to processes like distillation. The heat of transition in crystallisation is typically two to five times lower than in distillation \cite{noauthor_melt_nodate}. In the industry there are two kind of processes known as solution crystallisation and melt crystallisation. Solution crystallisation involves the use of solvent which could be environmentally unfriendly and recovering the solvent or disposing it will be costly. Whereas, melt crystallisers does not require any additional substances. Melt crystallisers are usually used to separate organic chemicals with favourable melting points. Typically, solvent crystallisation involves evaporating the solvent where the vapour phase occupies larger volume in the crystalliser. In the case of melt crystallisers only solid and liquid phases are involved allowing for smaller volumes which means less capital costs. Compared to solution crystallisers, the growth rate in melt crystalliser is also relatively fast \cite{myerson_handbook_2019}. Therefore, melt crystallisers were found to be more advantageous for separating p-NT from other organic chemicals. 

There are two main types of melt crystallisers present in the industry: solid-layer crystalliser and suspension crystalliser. In solid-layer crystallisers the crystal layer grows perpendicular to a cooled wall into the bulk of a melt known as the mother liquor. It is a multistage purification process. In contrast, suspended melt crystallisers involve crystals freely suspended in the melt. The crystallisation initiates on cooled surfaces and the crystals are scraped off. Therefore, crystal growth occurs on the crystals suspended in the melt \cite{myerson_handbook_2019}. Table \ref{tab:crystallisertype} shows the advantages and disadvantage of the two main crystalliser types discussed.

Even though solid-layer crystallisation has its obvious advantages, the fact that it is a multistage batch process made it unattractive. In suspension crystallisation the surface area for the same volume of crystals is approximately two to three order of magnitude higher than in solid-layer crystallisation \cite{noauthor_types_nodate}. Suspension crystallisation can achieve a high purity in one stage whilst layer crystallisation would require more stages to achieve the same level of purity. Hence, it would consume less energy compared to layer crystallisation. Moreover, Nitroma aims for continuous operation throughout the plant to eliminates dangers from material handling. Suspension crystalliser was more suitable for this purpose. Mixed-suspension mixed-product removal (MSMPR) was chosen. It operates continuously by producing a slurry of p-NT crystals and m-NT liquid.

In order to obtain p-NT at greater than 90 \% purity it has to be separated from m-NT and o-NT. Conventional solid-liquid separators are  typically operated in batch or semi-batch.Since Nitroma aims for a continuous plant these separators could not be considered. For instance, a centrifuge would require  solid material handling possibly using a conveyor belt to transport the solid. This has many difficulties and could become a bottle neck in the entire plant. Alternatively, wash columns were considered as they can be operated continuously and achieve ultrapurification.
