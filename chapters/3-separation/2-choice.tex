\section{Choice of separator}
The separation of p-nitrotoluene from m-nitrotoluene was designed in detail. P-nitrotoluene is an essential precursor to aminobenzaldehyde and aminobenzoic acid therefore it needs to be purified to at least --- \%. Due to the small difference in boiling points between p-NT and m-NT, distillation is infeasible and energy intensive. Similar solubility between the two components made the use of absorption or adsorption processes infeasible as well. However, crystallisers are deemed feasible due to the difference in melting points between p-nitrotoluene and m-nitrotoluene.

Melt crystallisers are particularly good for separating organic chemicals with favourable melting points. Compared to solution crystallisers, the concentration of the key component is usually much higher, and the growth rate in melt crystalliser is relatively fast. This leads to high purity of products and is thus economically favourable. It also avoids the possibility  of thermal degradation because it is typically operated at a cool temperature (1). From an environmental perspective, solution crystallisation often involves the addition of a solvent that is usually treated as impurity, whereas melt crystallisation does not require any additional substance. Melt crystalliser also known to be relatively cheaper - need to find cost info if possible.

Types of melt crystallisers include primarily solid-layer and suspension. 
Solid layer crystalliser:
advantages: avoid encrustation issue
disadvantages: higher investment costs, multistage process, not commonly used as continuous process

Suspension crystalliser:
advantages: moderate crystal growth and large surface areas, high purity product, continuous operation mode.
disadvantages: slurry handling,extras washing step required for solid-liquid separation, moving parts (1). 

Since the plant aims to operate continuously suspension crystalliser was more suitable than solid-layer crystalliser. A novel crystalliser known as mixed-suspension mixed-product removal (MSMPR) was chosen. It operates continuously by producing a slurry of p-nitrotoluene crystals and m-nitrotoluene liquid which will be further separated in a hydraulic wash column to attain purified molten p-nitrotoluene.
