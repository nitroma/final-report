\section{Process flow diagram (PFD) and stream table}
\label{app:PFD}
Following are the stream tables calculated for each of Nitroma's two operating scenarios: BA (4-aminobenzoic acid production) and BH (4-aminobenzaldehyde production). Component mass balances are shown as percentages of total mass flow.
