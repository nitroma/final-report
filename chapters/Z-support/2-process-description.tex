\section{Process description}

Nitroma's process for the nitration of toluene and subsequent reduction and hydrogenation of nitrotoluenes is unique in both its continuous operating mode and the production of three different substituted aromatic amines.  \Cref{fig:BFD-ES} is a simplified process flow diagram of the process.
