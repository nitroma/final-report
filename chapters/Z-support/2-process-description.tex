\section{Process description}

Nitroma's process for the nitration of toluene and subsequent reduction and hydrogenation of nitrotoluenes is unique in both its continuous operating mode and the production of three different substituted aromatic amines.  \Cref{fig:BFD-ES} is a simplified process flow diagram of the process.

Firstly, the nitration of toluene with 70\% aqueous nitric acid is carried out in a shell-and-tube heat exchanger reactor packed with H-mordenite catalyst. Solid acid catalysts were preferred over the traditional mixed-acid synthesis due to environmental, safety, economic and performance advantages. Zeolites indeed
