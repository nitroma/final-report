\section*{Process control and design}

Operational safety and efficiency are at the core of Nitroma's business. To ensure production and quality targets are consistently met while mitigating safety risks, a robust and sophisticated control strategy, with clear objective and sufficient protective structures, is critical.

A plant-wide control approach was adopted to design a control system capable of minimising disturbance propagation throughout the plant. Forty four process control structures were found to provide adequate disturbances management to achieve the design objectives. Control challenges and key maintenance issues along with associated mitigation strategies were discussed. The appropriate process throughput manipulator was identified as the speed of the pump feeding nitric acid and toluene to the nitration reactor. Since the nitration reaction produces the precursors for the three end-products in Nitroma's portfolio, this choice ensures that production demands are fulfilled.    

The o-toluidine production section was selected for the detailed control architecture design around the 2-nitrotoluene hydrogenation reactor and the methanol solvent distillation column. Robust ratio and temp controller
