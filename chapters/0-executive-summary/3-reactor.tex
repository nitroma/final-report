\section*{Reactor design}


Transitioning from batch to continuous process requires a complete redesign of the reactors that are commonly used in the industry today. Nitroma developed a novel approach of using a Heat Exchanger Reactor (HEX Reactor) for the nitration of toluene.

-steps taken to model (kinetics, Brinkman) 
- SiC immobilise
%modelling approach [andreas]
The model was implemented and optimised on COMSOL 5.6. 

%optimisation
To ensure the reactor operates in optimal conditions, the following parameters were optimised: Concentric inner cooling pipe diameter and flowrate, direction of cooling water flow, \ch{HNO3} : Toluene inlet ratio and the total number of tubes.

A further sensitivity analysis was performed on the cooling water inlet temperature because the temperature inside the reactor needs to be well-controlled at all times. Cooling water temperature was simulated to vary by \mypm $\Delta$ 5 K.

The length of the reactor was determined 
The cooling water is not expected to fluctuate this much 
The cooling water was sourced from to enhance energy recovery in the plant while
