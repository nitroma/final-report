Transitioning from batch to continuous process requires a complete redesign of the reactors that are commonly used in the industry today. Nitroma developed a novel approach of using a Heat Exchanger Reactor (HEX Reactor) for the nitration of toluene.

- SiC immobilise

The model was implemented and optimised on COMSOL 5.6. To ensure the reactor operates in optimal conditions, the following parameters were optimised: Concentric inner cooling pipe diameter and flowrate, direction of cooling water flow, \ch{HNO3} : Toluene inlet ratio and the total number of tubes.
