\section*{Separation system}

Separation of p-nitrotoluene from liquid mixture of p-nitrotoluene and m-nitrotoluene with trace amounts of o-nitrotoluene has been selected for detailed design. Due to the sizeable difference in melting points of p-nitrotoluene and m-nitrotoluene, crystallisation has been chosen as the separation methodology. A melt crystalliser has been designed where solid p-nitrotoluene crystallises out from the liquid mixture, and a hydraulic wash column has been designed in the immediate downstream to recover p-nitrotoluene from the stream.
