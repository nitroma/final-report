\section*{Separation system}

The separation of PNT from a liquid mixture of predominantly PNT and MNT with trace amounts of ONT has been selected for detailed design. The choice has been because PNT is an essential precursor for production of both aminobenzaldehyde and aminobenzoic acid and needs to be at least 90\% purity. Due to the negligible difference in boiling points yet sizeable difference in melting points of PNT and MNT, crystallisation has been chosen as the separation methodology. A cooling melt crystalliser has been designed to be implemented downstream of distillation column S103, where solid PNT would crystallise out from the liquid mixture. A subsequent hydraulic wash column has been designed immediately downstream of the crystalliser to recover pure solid PNT from the slurry. 


The crystalliser has been modelled as operating under mixed suspension mixed product removal (MSMPR) mode, where perfect mixing is assumed and the crystalliser operates at outlet conditions. The liquid mixture to be separated has been modelled as (PNT + MNT) binary system because the presence of ONT is negligible. This mixture exhibits a eutectic-forming solid-liquid phase behaviour, where PNT is able to crystallise from the mixture liquid as pure solid; the remaining liquid after this process is known as the mother liquor. Kinetics for crystal nucleation and growth and thermodynamic data were obtained from the literature and used for design calculations. An agitator has been implemented to achieve MSMPR operation and uniform temperature, and its geometry aims at minimising fouling in the vessel. To provide cooling for the crystalliser, a half pipe cooling coil surrounds the vessel through which cooling medium of 10\% ethylene glycol aqueous solution flows at \SI{7}{L/s} with temperature of \SI{274}{K}. Figure \ref{fig:crystalliser schematic executive} provides a 3D overview of the crystalliser design.


The hydraulic wash column separates out the crystal solid from the mother liquor. Solid crystals in suspension with the mother liquor from the crystalliser are introduced into the hydraulic wash column; they form a moving packed bed which would be transported by the hydraulic pressure along the column as sedimentation happens. At the bottom of the column, a set of rotating knives scrape the packed bed, and a melter is used to re-melt the crystals into liquid PNT. Filter tubes are implemented in the column where MNT and ONT filtrates are separated from the solid PNT. Some molten PNT ascends from the bottom of the wash column providing counter current washing of the packed bed. This method is a continuous process used for ultra-purification and is known to achieve 99.9\% separation of the crystallised component from the remaining; therefore, the overall recovery for PNT in the final product outlet has been assumed to be 99.9\%. The PNT purity in the final product stream is 100\% in theory for eutectic-forming systems as explained earlier. The diameter and steer flow rate were varied to observe the effect on the pressure drop along the height of the column. Herefrom, a diameter of 0.17 m, height of 0.8 m, and steer flow rate of 2.65 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ m$^{3}$/s have been deemed suitable. A sensitivity analysis has been conducted on the Kozeny constant to observe its impact on the pressure drop across the column. Figure \ref{fig:wash column schematic executive} is a 3D overview of the hydraulic wash column design.
