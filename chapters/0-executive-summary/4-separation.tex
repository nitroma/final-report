\section*{Separation system}

The separation of p-nitrotoluene from liquid mixture of p-nitrotoluene and m-nitrotoluene with trace amounts of o-nitrotoluene has been selected for detailed design. The choice has been because p-nitrotoluene is an essential precursor for production of both aminobenzaldehyde and aminobenzoic acid and needs to be at least 90\% purity. Due to the negligible difference in boiling points yet sizeable difference in melting points of p-nitrotoluene and m-nitrotoluene, crystallisation has been chosen as the separation methodology. A cooling melt crystalliser has been designed to be implemented downstream of distillation column S103, where solid p-nitrotoluene would crystallise out from the liquid mixture. A subsequent hydraulic wash column has been designed immediately downstream of the crystalliser to recover pure solid p-nitrotoluene from the liquid. 


An MSMPR crystallisre with an agitator was the choice of crystalliser to implement due to its
