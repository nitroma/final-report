\section*{Conclusion and recommendations}
Nitroma's continuous nitration plant is capable of an annual production of up to 650 tonnes of o-toluidine (95\% purity), up to 100 tonnes of 4-aminobenzoic acid (98\% purity) and up to 500 tonnes of 4-aminobenzaldehyde (98\% purity). Its modular plant design combines a thorough selection of product choices, along with novel designs of key process units, safety and environmental considerations and robust operational control to deliver a competitive and cutting-edge industrial solution for continuous production of high demand nitrated aromatic compounds. Nitroma's carefully selected products encompass a wide variety of end-uses such as in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and textiles, placing it in a good position to further penetrate a wide range of markets in the future, and plant modularity allows Nitroma flexibility in adjusting production of each product according to market demand. Coupled with an inherently safer continuous process design, Nitroma's plant presents itself as an attractive alternative to existing batch production of such products.
