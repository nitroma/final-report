\section*{Safety and environmental considerations}

Environmental, health and safety (EHS) considerations are paramount for Nitroma due to presence of major process hazards including fires, explosions and the release of hazardous chemicals. Compliance with all relevant EHS laws, regulations and standards regarding will be ensured.  During the initial design stage, inherent safety was implemented to reduce the risk as low as reasonably possible. A plant-wide risk assessment was conducted to identify hazards and associated risk to the people, plant and environment. Controls were put in place to manage the hazards identified. A hazard and operability study (HAZOP) was conducted on the plant section with the highest potential for damage, to evaluate the effectiveness of safeguards of the numerous deviations that could arise. Several recommendations from this study were then implemented, minimising the likelihood of the various risks from occurring as far as possible. For further reassurance, a layers of protection analysis (LOPA) was completed on one of the major consequences identified from the HAZOP – an explosion of the reaction vessel due to gaseous overpressure.  From this, a safety instrumented function of safety integrity level three was implemented, to cover the four initiating causes related to this consequence, allowing the cumulative event likelihood to fall below the target of 1x10-6.  

Nitroma waste prevention and minimisation involved choosing an alternative reducing agent and substituting sulphuric acid, which is known to be costly to dispose and environmentally unfriendly, with H-mordenite. This also avoided the formation of nitrogen oxides during nitration. The best techniques available were selected to treat waste streams. Liquid waste streams with nitric acid and high organic content were firstly neutralised with lime to treat the nitric acid and solid deposits were retained through a filter. The overall COD of the liquid waste effluent was reduced below the maximum limit of 250 mg/L by adsorption followed by anaerobic membrane bioreactor. All gaseous waste streams were incinerated, with a low NOx burner with the flue gas passing through a wet scrubber, minimising the NOx released. 

Finally, the plant layout was designed following a risk-based approach. The principle of flow was used for the equipment layout to avoid long pipelines and ensure efficient material flow. Dow’s fire and explosion index were identified for major process units handling flammable and unstable materials to determine the radius of exposure.
