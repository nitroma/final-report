\section{Background}

%Substituted aromatic amines are essential intermediates involved in the synthesis of many pharmaceutical compounds, agrochemicals, and dyes \cite{vogt_amines_2000}. The amino group, which cannot be directly introduced via electrophilic aromatic substitution, is instead added via nitration and subsequent reduction. Following multiple deadly industrial accidents in chemical plants performing batch nitration, Chinese authorities are actively attempting to strengthen the control and management of nitration manufacturing \cite{el_diario_china_2019}.
