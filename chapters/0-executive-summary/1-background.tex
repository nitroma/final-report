\section{Background}



%Substituted aromatic amines are essential intermediates involved in the synthesis of many pharmaceutical compounds, agrochemicals, and dyes \cite{vogt_amines_2000}. The amino group, which cannot be directly introduced via electrophilic aromatic substitution, is instead added via nitration and subsequent reduction. Following multiple deadly industrial accidents in chemical plants performing batch nitration, Chinese authorities are actively attempting to strengthen the control and management of nitration manufacturing \cite{el_diario_china_2019}.

%Substituted aromatic amines are essential intermediates involved in the synthesis of many pharmaceutical compounds, agrochemicals, and dyes \cite{vogt_amines_2000}. The easy replacement of the amino group by other functional groups makes them very attractive versatile intermediates. The amino group, which cannot be directly introduced via electrophilic aromatic substitution, is instead added via the nitration of the aromatic ring and subsequent reduction.
%Following multiple deadly industrial accidents in chemical plants performing batch nitration, especially the 2019 Xiangshui chemical plant explosion, Chinese authorities are actively attempting to strengthen the control and management of nitration manufacturing \cite{el_diario_china_2019}.
%Recent developments in flow chemistry are enabling process intensification of critical industrial processes to make them inherently safer. The transition from batch to continuous nitration opens up the possibility to safely manufacture important intermediates on a large-scale \cite{di_miceli_raimondi_safety_2015}.
