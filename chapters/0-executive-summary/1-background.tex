\section{Background}

Substituted aromatic amines are some of the most important intermediates in chemical manufacturing. There are indeed involved in the synthesis of many essential pharmaceutical compounds, agrochemicals, and dyes \cite{vogt_amines_2000}. Since the direct addition of the amino group via electrophilic aromatic substitution is not possible, it is introduced via nitration and subsequent reduction. 

Following multiple deadly industrial accidents in chemical plants performing batch nitration, especially the 2019 Xiangshui chemical plant explosion, Chinese authorities are actively attempting to strengthen the control and management of nitration manufacturing \cite{el_diario_china_2019}. Furthermore, global chemical firms, for whom most chemical plants in China produce intermediates, are urged to source their raw materials more responsibly by making informed decisions about suppliers rather than only wanting to buy from the cheapest [].

In this context, Nitroma, a foreign-invested enterprise, seeks to develop an inherently safer nitration process for the production of substituted aromatics amines intermediates, which fulfil the new safety and environmental standards imposed by Chinese authorities, while offering a socially responsible alternative to incumbent suppliers for multinational firms looking to green their image. 

Recent developments in flow chemistry and process intensification enable innovative designs of critical industrial processes to make them inherently safer. Nitroma will exploit the opportunity to transition  from batch to continuous nitration to safely manufacture important intermediates on a large-scale \cite{di_miceli_raimondi_safety_2015}. The optimum combination of amino derivatives of toluene to be produced by Nitroma was determined through multi-criteria decision methods. 4-aminobenzaldehyde, a precursor of pharmaceuticals and vanilin, \ortho-toluidine, an intermediate in the manufacture of herbicides, and 4-aminobenzoic acid,production of folic acid/vitamin B9)






2-aminobenzaldehyde (precursor of quinoline derivatives for polymer, agrochemical, dye, antiviral and anti-malaria drug manufacturing), 4-aminobenzaldehyde (intermediate to pharmaceuticals and vanilin), 4-aminobenzoic acid (production of folic acid/vitamin B9), \ortho-toluidine (intermediate in the manufacture of herbicides), \meta-toluidine (manufacture of  photographic color developer) and \para-toluidine (for dye production) \cite{bowers_toluidines_2000,bruhne_benzaldehyde_2011,maki_benzoic_2000}

%In this context, Nitroma seeks to develop an inherently safe, multi-purpose, continuous liquid-phase nitration process to produce o-toluidine, 4-aminobenzaldehyde and 4-aminobenzoic acid. This report details the preliminary design for Nitromaâ€™s demonstration plant, to be located in the Nanjing Chemical Industry Park (China). Synthesis pathways for nitration, oxidation and hydrogenation reactions were selected and modelled in innovative packed-bed microreactors or trickle-bed reactors. Novel downstream processing units, including continuous falling-film melt crystallisers, enable Nitroma to reach the target product purity. Finally, a techno-economic feasibility study was conducted, taking into account health, safety and environmental considerations.
