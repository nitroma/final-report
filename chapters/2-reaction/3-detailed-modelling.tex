\section{Detailed reactor modelling}
\subsection{Heat of reaction}
To understand the thermal effects of the reaction, the enthalpy of reaction was calculated. Literature studies of the nitration reaction mainly re
\subsection{Effectiveness factor}

\subsection{Axial dispersion}
The axial dispersion was calculated as it is an important parameter in affecting the performance and conversion of the packed-bed reactor. 

The axial dispersion coefficient can be calculated using the Taylor expression: 
\begin{equation}
    D_z=D_{ab}+\frac{(uD)^2}{192D_{ab}}
    \label{axial dispersion coefficient}
\end{equation}
The values of $D_{ab}$ was calculated using the Wilke-Chang correlation.
\begin{equation}
    D_{ab}=\frac{7.4\cdot 10^{-8}(\phi M_2)^{0.5}T}{\mu V_1^{0.6}}
    \label{wilkechang}
\end{equation}

The ratio of axial dispersion coefficient to the diameter of the tube has been plotted based on the equations \ref{axial dispersion coefficient} and \ref{wilkechang}.
\textcolor{red}{Insert Dz vs diameter graph here} 
From the graph, a diameter of 20cm has been selected as the optimal diameter based on graph X as minimal axial dispersion is preferred. 
\subsection{Adiabatic temperature}
