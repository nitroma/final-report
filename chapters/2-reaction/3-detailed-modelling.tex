\subsection{Axial dispersion}
The axial dispersion equation was used to calculate 

Dispersion equation can be defined as below
\begin{equation}
    D_z=D_{ab}+\frac{(uD)^2}{192D_{ab}}
    \label{axial dispersion coefficient}
\end{equation}
The values of $D_{ab}$ was calculated using the Wilke-Chang correlation.
\begin{equation}
    D_{ab}=\frac{7.4\cdot 10^{-8}(\phi M_2)^{0.5}T}{\mu V_1^{0.6}}
    \label{wilkechang}
\end{equation}

From the graph, a diameter of 20cm has been selected as the optimal diameter based on graph X as the
