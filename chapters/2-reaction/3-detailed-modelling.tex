\section{Detailed reactor modelling}
\subsection{Heat of reaction}
To understand the thermal effects of the reaction, the enthalpy of reaction was initially calculated using the enthalpy of formation for each compound participating in the reaction. Data on the standard heat of formation for the compounds were sourced from the NIST website and literature papers. A full table of the source of each enthalpy can be found in [link to appendix/ supporting info]. 

The enthalpy of reaction was calculated using Hess Law, as shown in the equation below:
\begin{equation}
  \Delta H_{r}^{T} = \Delta H_{f,nitrotoluene}^{T} + \Delta H_{f,water}^{T} - \Delta H_{f,toluene}^{T} - \Delta H_{f,nitric acid}^{T}
\end{equation}

Since the reaction was carried out at 330K, the enthalpy of reaction was adjusted to the operating temperature by using the heat capacities of the compounds using the equation below. The enthalpy of reaction was not further adjusted to capture the effects of pressure because pressure has a negligible effect on the overall enthalpy. 

\begin{equation}
  \Delta H_{r}^{330K} = \Delta H_{r}^{Standard \ state} + C_p \Delta T
\end{equation}

P-nitrotoluene is an exception, because it is a solid at standard state. Therefore, the latent heat of fusion needs to be included when adjusting the enthalpy of reaction to the operating temperature. 

The final enthalpy of reaction at 330K is calculated to be -116 kJ/mol. At the specified flowrates of the reactants, the heat duty of the reactor is -63.4 kW.

\subsection{Effectiveness factor}
H-Mordenite catalyst particles are used in the reaction. This creates a possibility of 

The effective diffusional coefficient is calculated to be 4.42  \times 10^{-10}, the widely-used equation 
\begin{equation}
    D_e = \frac{\epsilon_p D_p}{\tau_p}
\end{equation}
, where the intraparticle void fraction for H-mordenite is 0.463 from (saleman et al) and the tortuosity of the pellet was found to be 1.63 using the equation given in [ref]

For the ease of modelling, the pellets were assumed to be perfectly spherical. Therefore, the effectiveness factor is calculated as: 
\begin{equation}
    \eta = \frac{3}{\phi_{sphere}} \bigg(\frac{1}{tanh \phi_{sphere}} - \frac{1}{\phi_{sphere}}\bigg)
\end{equation}

At the [specify radius of particle], the Weisz-Prater  it can be considered that there are no diffusional limitations in the catalyst, and no concentration gradient. This pellet size is large enough to prevent a large pressure drop in the reactor while having negligible diffusional resistance within the pellet.


\subsection{Axial dispersion}
The axial dispersion was calculated as it is an important parameter in affecting the performance and conversion of the packed-bed reactor. 

The axial dispersion coefficient ($D_z$) can be calculated using the Taylor expression: 
\begin{equation}
    D_z=D_{ab}+\frac{(uD)^2}{192D_{ab}}
    \label{axial dispersion coefficient}
\end{equation}
The values of $D_{ab}$ was calculated using the Wilke-Chang correlation.
\begin{equation}
    D_{ab}=\frac{7.4\cdot 10^{-8}(\phi M_2)^{0.5}T}{\mu V_1^{0.6}}
    \label{wilkechang}
\end{equation}
where $D_z$ is the axial dispersion model, $D_{ab}$ is the diffusion coefficient $u$ is the superficial velocity, $\phi$ is the association parameter which is estimated to be 1 for toluene, $M_2$ is the molecular weight of the solvent which is calculated based on the volumetric ratio of nitric acid and water, $V_1$ is the molar volume of toluene at boiling point.
The axial dispersion coefficient ($D_z$) was calculated to for various diameters and plotted based on the equations \ref{axial dispersion coefficient} and \ref{wilkechang}.
\textcolor{red}{Insert Dz vs diameter graph here} 
From the graph, it can be observed that the dispersion coefficient decreases sharply after after ~10cm. Thus, a diameter of 20cm has been selected as any further increase in the diameter does not warrant the drawback of the increasing pressure drop ($\Delta P$).
