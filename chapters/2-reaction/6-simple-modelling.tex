\subsection{Hydrogenation of o-nitrotoluene}
After the production of the 3 nitrotoluene isomers, (mention separation?) ONT is mixed with propanol and hydrogenated to o-TOL in a co-current trickle bed reactor operating at 333K and 3 atm.

The rate equation for this equation can be defined as: 
\begin{equation}
    r = k P_{H_2}^{0.3} 
    \label{ONT rate equation}
\end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
    k = 211.69 \exp \bigg(-\frac{45.52 \cdot 10^{3}}{RT}\bigg) \frac{mol}{kPa^{0.3}g_{cat}s}
 \end{equation}

\subsection{Hydrogenation of nitrobenzaldehyde and nitrobenzoic acid}

\begin{scheme}[h]

    \ch{ NBA + HCOOH -> ABA + CO2 + H2O }

\end{scheme}

The hydrogenation of p-nitrobenzaldehyde and p-nitrobenzoic acid were carried out in methanol solvent with formic acid as the reducing agent. The reaction was carried out at room temperature and 1 atm. 5\% w/w Pt/C was chosen as the desired catalyst to speed up the reaction because it can be reused many times while maintaining its catalytic performance \cite{rahman_fast_2020}. The overall yield for 4-ABA and 4-ABH are 86\% and 80\% respectively as reported in [gowda and mahesh].
