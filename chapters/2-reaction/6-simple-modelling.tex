\section{Non-detailed reactor modelling}
\section{Appendix}
The effective diffusional coefficient is used to calculate Thiele modulus $\phi$ through the equation:
\begin{equation}
    \phi = r_p \sqrt{\frac{k_v}{D_e}}
\end{equation}
which is subsequently used to determine the effectiveness factor $\eta$. The catalysts are assumed to be perfectly spherical, and therefore the effectiveness factor is calculated as: 
\begin{equation}
\eta=\frac{3}{\phi_{\text {sphere }}}\left(\frac{1}{\tanh \phi_{\text {sphere }}}-\frac{1}{\phi_{\text {sphere }}}\right)
\end{equation}

To select the suitable catalyst size, the Weisz-Prater criterion is used. This criterion evaluates the effect of diffusional limitation within the pellet [ref] :
\begin{equation}
    \Phi = \eta \phi^2
\end{equation}
