\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
Detailed reactor design on the nitration of toluene was done, achieving a \SI{98}{\%} conversion and maintaining the temperature below the safe limit of \SI{363}{\K}. The reactor was modelled as a Heat Exchanger Reactor on COMSOL 5.6. A novel triple concentric tube arrangement along with silicon carbide foam were propo
The axial and radial reactor modelling was 

Optimisation and sensitivity analysis including Pareto frontier analysis were carried out on the key parameters, further demonstrating the robustness of the reactor model, thereby achieving the production target in a highly efficient and safe manner.
