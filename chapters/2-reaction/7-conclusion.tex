\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
Detailed reactor design on the nitration of toluene was done, achieving a \SI{98}{\%} conversion and maintaining the temperature below the safe limit of \SI{363}{\K}. The reactor was modelled as a Heat Exchanger Reactor on COMSOL 5.6. A novel triple concentric tube arrangement along with silicon carbide foam that was proposed for the reactor displayed superior heat transfer capabilities and high convers
The axial and radial reactor modelling was 

Optimisation and sensitivity analysis including Pareto frontier analysis were carried out on the key parameters such as reactor performance and reactor length, further demonstrating the robustness of the reactor model, thereby achieving the production target in a highly efficient and safe manner.
