\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
The reactor was modelled on COMSOL 5.6 with operating conditions of 1.3 bar below \SI{363}{\K} 
The axial and radial reactor modelling was 

Optimisation and sensitivity analysis on the key parameters demonstrated the robustness of the reactor model, thereby achieving the production target in a highly efficient and safe manner.
