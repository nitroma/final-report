\section{Conclusion and outlook} \label{sec:conclusion}
Detailed reactor design on the nitration of toluene was done, achieving a \SI{98}{\%} conversion and maintaining the temperature below the safe limit of \SI{363}{\K}. The reactor was modelled as a 2D Heat Exchanger Reactor on COMSOL 5.6. A novel triple concentric tube arrangement along with silicon carbide foam that was proposed for the reactor displayed superior heat transfer capabilities and high conversion. Optimisation and sensitivity analysis including Pareto frontier analysis were carried out on the key parameters such as reactor temperature and reactor length, which showed the robustness of the reactor model in achieving the production target in a highly efficient and safe manner. 

Current works only involve a maximum of 3 parameter multiobjective optimisation. As part of efforts to fully understand the impact of key parameters for optimising the reactor, future work should involve a multiobjective optimisation with all the key parameters investigated simultaneously. Additionally, mixing between phases can be enhanced further with the introduction of static mixers. These steps will help Nitroma meet the necessary sep
