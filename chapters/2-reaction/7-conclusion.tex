This report outlined the us
Detailed reactor design on the nitration of toluene was done, achieving a 

The reactor was modelled on COMSOL 5.6 with operating conditions of 1.3 bar and \SI{< 363}{\K}.
The axial and radial reactor modelling was 

Optimisation and sensitivity analysis including Pareto frontier analysis were carried out on the key parameters, further demonstrating the robustness of the reactor model, thereby achieving the production target in a highly efficient and safe manner.
