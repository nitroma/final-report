\subsection{Nitration of toluene}
\label{sec:R1-kinetics}
The nitrotoluene production was achieved by  reacting \SI{95}{\%_{w/v}} toluene and \SI{70}{\%_{w/v}} nitric acid to produce 3 different nitrotoluene isomers of ONT, MNT and PNT in a heat-exchanger tubular reactor operating at 330K and 1 atm. This reaction is catalysed by solid H-Mordenite.

Nitric acid interacts with the Br√∏nsted acid sites on H-Mordenite by forming a hydrogen bond with the \ch{H+} proton \cite{chary_zeolite_2016}. This forms an intermediate nitronium ion \ch{NO2+} and water molecule \ch{H2O}. The nitronium ion then undergoes electrophilic substitution with the aromatic ring of toluene to form nitrotoluenes. Due to the electron-donating inductive effect of the methyl group on toluene, \textit{ortho}- and \textit{para}- positions are favoured for nitrotoluene.

%The nitration of toluene will not result in the production of dinitrotoluene and trinitrotoluene, as the huge reactivity difference allows one to selectively mononitrate an aromatic rings without over-nitration problems. 

The nitration of toluene is governed by intrinsic kinetics under the experimental conditions \cite{jeeru_kinetics_2018}. The electrophilic substitution between the \ch{NO2+} nitronium ion and toluene is the rate determining step \cite{carey_advanced_2007}. The rate equation can be defined as  
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\dd C_\mathrm{Toluene}}{\dd t} = k_{2} \cdot [C_\mathrm{Toluene}] \cdot [C_\text{Nitric Acid}] \approx k_{1} \cdot [C_\mathrm{Toluene}]
\end{equation}
where $k_2$, $k_1$ are the second-order and pseudo-first order rate constant respectively. A pseudo-first order rate constant can be assumed since nitric acid is in excess. The rate constant varies with temperature according to the Arrhenius equation and this information was extracted from the Arrhenius plot in \textcite{jeeru_kinetics_2018}. Instead of having a single aggregated rate equation for the reaction of toluene to all 3 nitrotoluene isomers, individual rate equations for each isomer is calculated. Dinitrotoluene and trinitrotoluene can be assumed to be negligible, since toluene is 8 orders of magnitude more reactive than mononitrotoluene [barden]. The presence of additional nitro groups that are electron-withdrawing deactivates the aromatic ring, thus reducing its reactivity. [vassena highly selective] also showed that the yield of dinitrotoluene is negligible for H-Mordenite catalysed reaction. The nitration of toluene to mononitrotoluene w

A summary of the activation energies and pre-exponential factors for the formation of all 3 isomers of nitrotoluene can be found in \cref{tab:R1-kinetic-params}. The catalyst loading of \SI{30}{\percent\wv} of H-Mordenite that gave the highest rate of reaction was selected from \textcite{jeeru_kinetics_2018}.
