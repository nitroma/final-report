\subsection{Nitration of toluene}
\label{sec:R1-kinetics}
The nitrotoluene production was achieved by  reacting \SI{95}{\%_{w/v}} toluene and \SI{70}{\%_{w/v}} nitric acid to produce 3 different nitrotoluene isomers of ONT, MNT and PNT in a heat-exchanger tubular reactor operating at 330K and 1 atm. This reaction is catalysed by solid H-mordenite.

Nitric acid interacts with the Br√∏nsted acid sites on H-Mordenite by forming a hydrogen bond with the \ch{H+} proton \cite{chary_zeolite_2016}. This forms an intermediate nitronium ion \ch{NO2+} and water molecule \ch{H2O}. The nitronium ion then undergoes electrophilic substitution with the aromatic ring of toluene to form nitrotoluenes. The electron-donating inductive effect of the methyl group on toluene favors ortho and para positions for nitrotoluene.

%The nitration of toluene will not result in the production of dinitrotoluene and trinitrotoluene, as the huge reactivity difference allows one to selectively mononitrate an aromatic rings without over-nitration problems. 

As toluene is 8 times more reactive with nitric acid than nitrotoluene, the huge reactivity difference allows for the mononitration process without over-nitration problems. This reduces the need for additional separation procedure to separate mononitrotoluene, dinitrotoluene and trinitrotoluene(). Moreover, the absence of additional reactants including phosphoric acid and chloroacetyl nitrates reduces the conversion of mononitrotoluene into dinitrotoluene. ()()

The nitration of toluene is governed by intrinsic kinetics under the experimental conditions \cite{jeeru_kinetics_2018}. The electrophilic substitution between the \ch{NO2+} nitronium ion and toluene is the rate determining step \cite{carey_advanced_2007}. The rate equation can be defined as  

\begin{equation}
-\frac{\dd C_{Toluene}}{\dd t} = k_{2} \cdot [C_{Toluene}] \cdot [C_{Nitric Acid}] \approx k_{1} \cdot [C_{Toluene}]
\end{equation}

where $k_2$, $k_1$ are the second-order and pseudo-first order rate constant respectively. A pseudo-first order rate constant can be assumed since nitric acid is in excess. The rate constant varies with temperature according to the Arrhenius equation and this information was extracted from the Arrhenius plot in \textcite{jeeru_kinetics_2018}. Instead of having a single aggregated rate equation for the reaction of toluene to all 3 nitrotoluene isomers, individual rate equations for each isomer is calculated. The summary table of the activation energies and pre-exponential factors for the formation of all 3 isomers of nitrotoluene can be found in Appendix \ref{tab:kineticsdata}. The catalyst loading of \SI{30}{\%} w/v of H-mordenite that gave the highest rate of reaction was selected from \textcite{jeeru_kinetics_2018}.
