\section{Mechanical design}
\subsection{Reactor material}
Temperature, max allowable pressure, ability to handle xxx pressure gradient, 

Due to the strong oxidising property, nitric acid is very corrosive at 70 mass\% 
The chosen reactor material must be acid-resistant, 

-chosen material to be stainless steel 304L based on paper
