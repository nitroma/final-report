Due to the strong oxidising property, nitric acid is very corrosive at 70 mass\% and has poses a significant safety threat to the plant. According to ref, an increase in corrosion potential with increase in acid concentration can be attributed to the autocatalytic reduction of nitric acid. 

Several stainless steel with low-carbon or stabilized austenitic grades have been shortlisted for selection:
