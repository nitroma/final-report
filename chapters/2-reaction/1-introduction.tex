This report aims to design a feasible functioning reactor for the production of o-toluidine, 4-aminobenzaldehyde and 4-aminobenzoic acid. The two (?) major challenges in this reactor design are namely:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The safety risk of a highly exothermic nitration process of converting toluene into nitrotoluene. 
    \item Transitioning away from an batch process into a continuous process which was done 
\end{enumerate}

In line with Nitroma's goal of transitioning from batch to continuous process,
