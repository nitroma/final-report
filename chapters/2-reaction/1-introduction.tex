\section{Introduction}
%he development of a continuous process for the nitration process of toluene into nitrotoluene has been
This report aims to design a feasible functioning reactor for the production of o-toluidine, 4-aminobenzaldehyde and 4-aminobenzoic acid. The two (?) major challenges in this reactor design are namely:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The safety risk of a highly exothermic nitration process of converting toluene into nitrotoluene and to ensure an inherently safer continuous nitration process. 
    \item Transitioning away from a batch process which was mainly used in similar fine chemicals manufacture, into continuous process. 
\end{enumerate}
