R401 and R501 will be lined with glass for additional protection against corrosion, due to presence of benzoic acids and formic acid. As well as protection against acid corrosion, the presence of hydrogen has little effect on the fatigue life of SS316 \cite{omura_hydrogen_2012}, which is favourable for R201 (in which hydrogenation occurs).
