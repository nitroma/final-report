Synthron  Morganton, North Carolina (31 Jan 2006) â€“ thermal runaway and vapour cloud explosion   & \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em]\item Attempting to meet higher production demand for paint additive product, the reaction was scaled up by increasing the quantity of monomer charged into reactor by 12\% \item The rate of energy release increased more than two-fold that its normal value, exceeding the cooling capacity of the reactor condenser\item A thermal runaway reaction resulted from this, with this in turn increasing the pressure within the system. The venting of the solvent vapours (in the presence of an ignition source) lead to a vapour cloud explosion.\end{itemize}                                                                                                                                           & \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em]\item 1 fatality and 14 injuries (2 of which were serious).\item The explosion destroyed the plant\item Further damage to buildings and structures in the surrounding community.\end{itemize}                                                                           & \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em]\item There must be an adequate hazard identification process conducted for initial design\item Plant personnel must be fully aware of safety policies and standard operating procedures\end{itemize}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\

The sludge was being cleaned out using a metal rake. \item Thermally unstable residues in contact with steam heated battery underwent exothermic decomposition which produced sufficient energy to auto-ignite a flammable mixture of MNT vapours or decomposition products.\end{itemize} & \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em]\item Main office building damaged from fire. \item 5 fatalities and some suffered severe burns\item Many people, such as firefighters, became ill suggesting toxic effects or infectious disorders, possibly from the cold drink they consumed at the site.\end{itemize} & \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em]\item Still residues should be analysed, monitored and removed at regular intervals to prevent possible build-up of unstable impurities in batch distillation\item Use of chemical plant for a different process is a plant change and required rigorous assessment. Authorisation should be obtained from appropriate level of management\item The design and location of control and other buildings near chemical plant processing flammable/ toxic substance should be assessed for potential fire, explosion and toxic releases. Mitigating action should be in place.\end{itemize} \\
