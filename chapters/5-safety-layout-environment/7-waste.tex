\subsection{Waste prevention and minimisation }

Nitroma is conscious of the adverse effects our activities will may have on the environment. The company strives to set an industry standard for conducting environmentally sustainable in the chemical manufacture field. The prevention and minimisation of waste are key to achieving this goal. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item use of formic acid over ammonium formate for Hydrogenation to 4-aminobenzaldehyde and 4-aminobenzoic acid, preventing ammonia formation 
    \item using H-Modernite catalyst as catalyst for nitration reaction instead of sulfuric acid, significantly reducing NOx emissions
    \item integration of various recycle streams
\end{itemize}
