\subsection{Waste prevention and minimisation }

Nitroma is conscious of the adverse effects our activities will may have on the environment. The company strives to set an industry standard for conducting environmentally sustainable in the chemical manufacture field. The prevention and minimisation of waste are key to achieving this goal. 

The selection of compounds utilised in the various plant reactions allowed waste prevention. For the hydrogenation to 4-aminobenzaldehyde and 4-aminobenzoic acid, a choice was made between two reducing agents, formic acid and ammonium formate. Whist ammonium formate was more favourable in terms of
