\section{Layers of protection analysis (LOPA)}

A LOPA was conducted for one of the major consequences identified from the HAZOP analysis. Focusing on node 1, the chosen consequence was overpressure in R201, resulting to a fire (due to presence of flammable materials and oxidant) and explosion . This consequence was chosen due to the significant affects and losses that are associated with a fire and explosion caused by overpressurization, which includes the loss of production of o-toluidine, the release of harmful substance and subsequent damage to the multiple environments (air, land), equipment and possibly major plant damage and serious injury/fatality for those within the facility. 

There are three main initiating causes (ICs) which can lead to overpressurization of the reaction vessel that have been identified;

\begin{itemize}
\item Failure of pressure controller, PIC201 due to set point being too high in error
\item Bed blockage within in reactor R201, causing build up of pressure
\item Blockage in FCV-202, restricting hydrogen recycle stream from reactor R201

\end{itemize}

The first two ICs are classified as a basic process control system failure, whilst the third IC is a fault that is independent of control system. For this major consequence, the target mitigated event likelihood (TMEL) taken as 1x10-5yr-1, which corresponds to one onsite fatality as a result of the explosion. This is the commonly used TMEL used by many
