\section{Introduction}

At Nitroma, safety, health, and environmental considerations are fundamental elements of our company ethos. Our priority is to manufacture products of the highest quality whilst ensuring the safety of the people (both within the workplace and the community) and of the product itself. Nitroma aims to eliminate (or minimise as much as possible) any adverse impact our operations may have on the environment. Our commitment to the environment, health and safety (EHS) is reflected through our practices which comply to all the relevant legislation and regulations. Inherent safety formed the basis of Nitromaâ€™s plant design, with the safety always at the forefront of important decisions, including the synthesis pathway, equipment and material selection and plant location and layout. Furthermore, thorough investigations were conducted to ensure all the necessary independent layers of protection were integrated to achieve the highest standard of safety. The comprehensive evaluation of any potential hazards and risks conducted ensures that any possible safety or environmental threats are as low as reasonably possible. Our innovative process system allows Nitroma to manufacture the finest aromatic amine products, fit for pharmaceutical use whilst fulfilling our environmental, health and safety responsibilities.
