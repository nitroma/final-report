\section{Plant-wide risk assessment}

According to Lee’s, the major hazards associated to a chemical process plant like Nitroma’s, are fires, explosions and the release of toxic chemicals. Nitroma takes these hazards very seriously, and thus (through identification and analysis of hazards associated to these incidents), we plan to implement appropriate controls which will either prevent or significantly minimise both the likelihood and severity. 


\subsection{Fires and explosions}

A fire arises from a chemical combustion reaction which requires four elements from the 'fire tetrahedron' - fuel, oxidant, heat and radicals. Nitroma has identified two oxidants present in the process, oxygen and nitric acid. There have also been multiple flammable substances identified, with hydrogen gas holding the highest flammability (with a NFPA 704 rating of 4). 

Due to the significantly exothermic nature of all the synthesis reactions (especially the nitration reaction), there is a potential risk of thermal runaway, should there be an uncontrollable temperature rise of the system. The occurrence of a thermal runaway reaction may in turn lead to fires and explosions.  

Furthermore, due to the high pressure of hydrogen gas in reactor R201, there may is a risk of explosion caused by overpressure. Taking these potential hazards and risks into account, Nitroma has devised various controls to manage each of these issues effectively.  


\begin{itemize}
    \item installation of a cooling jacket on each reactor to control heat transfer
    \item installation of pressure and temperature indicators to allow constant monitoring, with alarms in place to warn operator of deviation from normal
    \item -	Installation of control which will stop flow into reactor, should the temperature rise uncontrollably
    \item reactor units operate at lowest possible temperature that allows production target range to be achieved
    \item install pressure relief valves, stopping reaction when pressure increases significantly 
    \item Keep flammable materials below their auto-ignition temperature, and away from other sources of ignition
    \item Increased distance between reactor and separation units to prevent sequential events should a fire or explosion occur
    \item installation of fire detectors and alarms
    \item define emergency shut down procedures in case controls fail to prevent temperature rise
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Dust explosions}

A dust explosion is a specific type of explosion that requires the dispersion of a combustible dust in a confined space in the presence of a ignition source, oxygen and fuel. The use of catalytic  palladium (on a carbon support) is a threat of 



\subsubsection{Fire and Explosion Index}

To provide an initial quantitative hazard identification measurement, Dow's fire and explosion (F\&E index) was calculated for each of the reactors in the process. This calculation allows an estimation of the scale of damage that would be experienced, should a fire or explosion occur. The F\&E index also gives an indication as to which unit is most liable to damage. 


\subsection{Release of toxic materials}

Whilst measures have been taken to reduce the hazardous inventory of the plant, there will be numerous chemical substances present at Nitroma's process plant, which can be hazardous to human health and the surrounding environment. The primary cause of exposure of toxic substances is due to loss of containment during normal operation and during maintenance. As mentioned previously, the continuous nature of the process plant will allow minimal handling of chemicals, the workforce may still be at risk of exposure due to transfer of imports and exports. Unintentional emissions of untreated substances can have an adverse impact on land, air and sea, potentially inflicting serious long-term effects. To prevent and mitigate the risk, the following measures have been taken;

\begin{itemize}
    \item installation of ventilation systems to remove any toxic vapours or fumes that may emit into the air
    \item label storage area with hazard warnings and ensure area is clear from obstructions 
    \item ensure workforce are fully trained 
    \item regular checks o
    \item placement of emergency showers and eye-wash 
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Past Incidents}

Nitroma recognises the importance of learning from events in the past and so an important aspect of hazard identification is the review of historical case studies. Nitroma hopes to learn from these past mistakes and accidents and use this as insight for the safety of our process plant
