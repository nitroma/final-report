\section{Plant-wide risk assessment}

The major hazards associated to a chemical process plant like Nitroma’s, are fires, explosions and the release of toxic chemicals. Nitroma takes these hazards very seriously, and thus (through identification and analysis of hazards associated with these incidents), we plan to implement appropriate controls which will either prevent or significantly minimise both the likelihood and severity.

\subsection{Past Incidents}

Nitroma recognises the importance of learning from events in the past and so an important aspect of hazard identification is the review of historical case studies. Nitroma hopes to learn from these past mistakes and accidents and use this as insight for the safety of our process plant.

\subsection{Fire and explosions}

Fire arises from chemical combustion reactions which require four elements from the 'fire tetrahedron' - fuel, oxidant, heat and radicals. Nitroma has identified two oxidants present in the process, oxygen and nitric acid. There have also been multiple flammable substances identified, with hydrogen gas holding the highest flammability (with a NFPA 704 rating of 4). 

Due to the significantly exothermic nature of all the synthesis reactions (especially the nitration reaction), there is a potential risk of thermal runaway, should there be an uncontrollable temperature rise of the system. The occurrence of a thermal runaway reaction may in turn lead to fire and explosions.  

Furthermore, due to the high pressure of hydrogen gas in reactor R201, there is a risk of explosion caused by overpressure. Taking these potential hazards and risks into account, Nitroma has devised various controls to manage each of these issues effectively; 


\begin{itemize}
    \item installation of a cooling jacket on each reactor to control heat transfer
    \item installation of pressure and temperature indicators to allow constant monitoring, with alarms in place to warn operator of deviation from normal operating conditions
    \item Installation of control which will stop flow into the reactor, should temperature rise uncontrollably
    \item reactor units operate at lowest possible temperature that allows production target range to be achieved
    \item installation of pressure relief valves, stopping reaction when pressure increases significantly %significantly or above set point?  
    \item Keep flammable materials below their auto-ignition temperature, and away from ignition sources
    \item Increased distance between equipment to prevent sequential damage and events
    \item installation of fire detectors and alarms
    
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Dust explosions}

A dust explosion is a specific type of explosion that requires the dispersion of a combustible dust in a confined space in the presence of an ignition source, oxygen and fuel. As mentioned previously, the use of palladium-on-carbon as a catalyst presents a pathway to a dust explosion occurring as it is classed as a combustible dust. Whilst the pellet form of the catalyst will be used, there may be carbon powder residue on the pellets and so dust explosion is still possible. To minimise the risk of this specific explosion from occurring, the following measures have been employed;

\begin{itemize}
    \item regular dust inspections 
    \item installation of a vacuum dust collector system 
    \item implementation of static grounding for storage of palladium-on-carbon catalyst  
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Release of toxic materials}

Whilst measures have been taken to reduce the hazardous inventory of the plant, there will be numerous chemical substances present at Nitroma's process plant, which can be hazardous to human health and the surrounding environment. The primary cause of exposure of toxic substances is due to loss of containment during normal operation and during maintenance. As mentioned previously, the continuous nature of the process plant will allow minimal handling of chemicals, the workforce may still be at risk of exposure due to transfer of imports and exports. Unintentional emissions of untreated substances can have an adverse impact on land, air and sea, potentially inflicting serious long-term effects. To prevent and mitigate the risk, the following measures have been taken;

\begin{itemize}
    \item installation of ventilation systems to remove any toxic vapours or fumes 
    \item installation of level indicators and alarms to prevent overflow in reactor vessels 
    \item label storage area with hazard warnings and ensure area is clear from obstructions
    \item ensure workforce are fully trained, following MSDS procedures and guidance for each of the substances in the process and are equipped with appropriate PPE 
    \item regular inspection of storage and process lines, to identity any leaks or damage
    \item carry out regular medical examinations for plant personnel to identify any health issues related to toxicological effects of chemicals on-site
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Specific Hazardous Chemical }

The hazards associated to each of the chemicals used within the plant have  been identified through the use of the the Globally Harmonized System (GHS). The hazard codes associated to each substance has been listed and communicated to the entire workforce at Nitroma, so staff have a full understanding of hazards. Whilst all chemicals must be treated with caution, in this section we draw attention to some of the key substances in relation to the NFPA 704 values concerning health, flammability and reacivity. 

\subsubsection{Flammability}

There are three compounds which are regarded as highly flammable, toluene and methanol with a rating of 3, and hydrogen gas with the highest rating of 4. These materials will be stored below 22°C, with the hydrogen storage isolated from all other storage units (see plant layout)

\subsubsection{Health}


Whilst given the rating of 2, it is important to note that cobalt phthalocyanine is susceptible of causing cancer 





\subsection{Emergency procedures and measures}

Whilst Nitroma has identified potential hazards which may compromise the health and safety of the workforce and taken appropriate measures to control these effectively, we recognise that accidents may still occur and have thus put a number of emergency measures in place. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item placement of emergency showers, eye-wash unit and respirators
    \item An on-site fire-station 
    \item Emergency exits in each section of the plant (see plant layout) for efficient evacuation 
\item  
\end{itemize}
