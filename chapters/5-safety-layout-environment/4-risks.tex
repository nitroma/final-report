\section{Plant-wide risk assessment}

The major hazards associated to a chemical process plant like Nitromaâ€™s, are fires, explosions and the release of toxic chemicals. Nitroma takes these hazards very seriously, and thus (through identification and analysis of hazards associated to these incidents), we plan to implement appropriate controls which will either prevent or significantly minimise both the likelihood and severity.

\subsection{Past Incidents}

Nitroma recognises the importance of learning from events in the past and so an important aspect of hazard identification is the review of historical case studies. 


Nitroma hopes to learn from these past mistakes and accidents and use this as insight for the safety of our process plant.

\subsection{Fires and explosions}

A fire arises from a chemical combustion reaction which requires four elements from the 'fire tetrahedron' - fuel, oxidant, heat and radicals. Nitroma has identified two oxidants present in the process, oxygen and nitric acid. There have also been multiple flammable substances identified, with hydrogen gas holding the highest flammability (with a NFPA 704 rating of 4). 

Due to the significantly exothermic nature of all the synthesis reactions (especially the nitration reaction), there is a potential risk of thermal runaway, should there be an uncontrollable temperature rise of the system. The occurrence of a thermal runaway reaction may in turn lead to fires and explosions.  

Furthermore, due to the high pressure of hydrogen gas in reactor R201, there may is a risk of explosion caused by overpressure. Taking these potential hazards and risks into account, Nitroma has devised various controls to manage each of these issues effectively; 


\begin{itemize}
    \item installation of a cooling jacket on each reactor to control heat transfer
    \item installation of pressure and temperature indicators to allow constant monitoring, with alarms in place to warn operator of deviation from normal
    \item Installation of control which will stop flow into reactor, should the temperature rise uncontrollably
    \item reactor units operate at lowest possible temperature that allows production target range to be achieved
    \item install pressure relief valves, stopping reaction when pressure increases significantly 
    \item Keep flammable materials below their auto-ignition temperature, and away from other sources of ignition
    \item Increased distance between reactor and separation units to prevent sequential events should a fire or explosion occur
    \item installation of fire detectors and alarms
    
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Dust explosions}

A dust explosion is a specific type of explosion that requires the dispersion of a combustible dust in a confined space in the presence of a ignition source, oxygen and fuel. As mentioned previously, the use of palladium-on-carbon as a catalyst presents a pathway to a dust explosion occurring as it is classed as a combustible dust. Whilst the pellet form of the catalyst will be used, there may be carbon powder residue on the pellets and so dust explosion is still possible. To minimise the risk of this specific explosion from occurring, the following measures have been employed;

\begin{itemize}
    \item regular dust inspections 
    \item installation of a vacuum dust collector system 
    \item implementation of static grounding for storage of palladium-on-carbon catalyst  
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Fire and Explosion Index}

To provide an initial quantitative hazard identification measurement, Dow's fire and explosion (F\&E index) was calculated for each of the reactors in the process. This calculation allows an estimation of the scale of damage that would be experienced, should a fire or explosion occur. The F\&E index also gives an indication as to which unit is most liable to damage. 


\subsection{Release of toxic materials}

Whilst measures have been taken to reduce the hazardous inventory of the plant, there will be numerous chemical substances present at Nitroma's process plant, which can be hazardous to human health and the surrounding environment. The primary cause of exposure of toxic substances is due to loss of containment during normal operation and during maintenance. As mentioned previously, the continuous nature of the process plant will allow minimal handling of chemicals, the workforce may still be at risk of exposure due to transfer of imports and exports. Unintentional emissions of untreated substances can have an adverse impact on land, air and sea, potentially inflicting serious long-term effects. To prevent and mitigate the risk, the following measures have been taken;

\begin{itemize}
    \item installation of ventilation systems to remove any toxic vapours or fumes 
    \item installation of level indicators and alarms to prevent overflow in reactor vessels 
    \item label storage area with hazard warnings and ensure area is clear from obstructions
    \item ensure workforce are fully trained, following MSDS procedures and guidance for each of the substances in the process and are equipped with appropriate PPE 
    \item regular inspection of storage and process lines, to identity any leaks or damage
    \item carry out regular health examinations for plant personnel to identity any toxicological related issues
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Chemical index}

\subsection{Emergency procedures and measures}

\begin{itemize}
    \item placement of emergency showers, eye-wash unit and respirators
    \item fire-station on site 
    \item Establishment of an evacuation plan 
\end{itemize}
