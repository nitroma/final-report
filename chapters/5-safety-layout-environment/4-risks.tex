\section{Qualitative plant wide risk assessment}

The major hazards in a chemical process plants like Nitroma’s, are fires, explosions and the release of toxic chemicals \cite{mannan_lees_2012}. Nitroma takes these hazards very seriously, and thus, through the identification and analysis of hazards associated with these incidents, plans to implement appropriate controls which will either prevent or significantly minimise the likelihood and/or severity. 


\subsection{Past Incidents}

Nitroma recognises the importance of learning from events in the past and so an important aspect of hazard identification is the review of historical case studies. Incidents explored include thermal runaway, explosion, storage of hazardous chemicals and acid spillage, all of which are relevant risks. Nitroma hopes to learn from these past mistakes and accidents and use this as insight for the safety of our process plant.

\subsection{Fire and explosions}

Fire from chemical combustion reactions require four elements from the 'fire tetrahedron': fuel, oxidant, heat and radicals. Nitroma has identified two oxidants present in the process, oxygen and nitric acid. Multiple flammable substances have also been identified, with hydrogen gas holding the highest flammability (with a NFPA 704 rating of 4). Due to the significantly exothermic nature of all the synthesis reactions (especially the nitration reaction), there is a potential risk of thermal runaway, should there be an uncontrollable temperature rise in the system. The occurrence of a thermal runaway reaction may lead to a fire and explosion.  

Furthermore, due to the high pressure of hydrogen gas in reactor R201, there is a risk of explosion caused by overpressure. Taking these potential hazards and risks into account, Nitroma has devised various controls to manage each of these issues effectively: 


\begin{itemize}
\item Installation of pressure and temperature transmitters with alarms to allow constant monitoring and defined operator actions in the case of deviation from normal operating conditions.
         \item Executive temperature and pressure alarms on process units with an interlock to shut down units before fire or explosion can occur. 
         \item Cooling jackets around major reactor units (and in the case of R101, a cooling tube will be placed within the reactor itself), to maintain operating temperature and prevent thermal runaway.
          \item Installation of pressure relief valves which will relieve the pressure of a certain region (should the value rise above the specified set point).
    \item Increased distance between equipment and storage units to prevent sequential damage and events.
    \item Storage units containing flammable and toxic materials will be encased by a bund as protection against leakage.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Dust explosions}

A dust explosion is a specific type of explosion that requires the dispersion of a combustible dust in a confined space in the presence of an ignition source, oxygen and fuel. As mentioned previously, the use of palladium-on-carbon as a catalyst presents a pathway to a dust explosion occurring as it is classed as a combustible dust. Whilst the pellet form of the catalyst will be used, there may be carbon powder residue on the pellets and so dust explosion is still possible. The plant will have a carefully situated ventilation system to minimise the escape of dust in these areas, and regular checks will be performed to ensure there is no dust build up.
Frequent inspections on all process units and storage areas will be carried out, with specific guidelines on cleaning put in place. 

\subsection{Hazardous chemicals \& their potential release}

The hazards associated with each of the chemicals used within the plant have been identified through the use of the Globally Harmonized System (GHS). The hazard codes for each substance have been listed and communicated to the entire workforce at Nitroma, so staff have a full understanding of hazards. Whilst all chemicals must be treated with caution, here we will draw attention to some of the key substances in relation to the NFPA 704 values concerning health, flammability and reactivity. 

\paragraph{Flammability:}

Hydrogen gas is the most flammable substance on-site, the only chemical with a NFPA flammability rating of 4.  Hydrogen is extremely flammable at atmospheric conditions and will readily disperse in air if emitted. As such, care must be taken to ensure that hydrogen is handled appropriately, with safe storage, material selection and use within the process. The hydrogen gas will be stored in a pressure container placed outside in an isolated area of the plant, away from other storage units, equipment and ignition source.  Toluene and methanol are also highly flammable, with a rating of 3. These liquids will be stored in a bund surrounding their respective storage vessels. 


\paragraph{Health:}

The substance with the highest NFPA rating of 4 for health was nitric acid, with oxygen, p-toluidine, o-toludine and the nitrotoluenes  following with a rating of 3. There will be restricted access to areas containing these chemicals with personal protective equipment (including gloves, face masks and shield goggles) provided for those with access to these sites. Minimal human interaction is required in the production area to reduce the risk of exposure.

\paragraph{Reactivity:}

All chemicals in the process were rated between 0-1, indicating these substances are relatively stable, however controls will be put in place to ensure that both the reaction conditions and storage conditions are met. 

There are numerous chemical substances at Nitroma's process plant which can be hazardous to human health and the surrounding environment. The primary cause of exposure to toxic substances is due to loss of containment during normal operation and during maintenance. As mentioned previously, the continuous nature of the process plant will allow minimal handling of chemicals, but the workforce may still be at risk of exposure due to transfer of imports and exports. Unintentional emissions of untreated toxic substances can have an adverse impact on land, air and sea, potentially inflicting serious long-term effects. To prevent and mitigate the risk, the following measures have been taken;

\begin{itemize}
    \item Installation of ventilation systems to remove any toxic vapours or fumes. 
    \item Installation of level indicators and alarms to prevent overflow in reactor vessels , with interlocks in place to act if level is critically high.
    \item Label storage area with hazard warnings and ensure area is clear from obstructions.
    \item Ensure workforce is fully trained, following MSDS procedures and guidance for each of the substances in the process and are equipped with appropriate PPE.
    \item Regular inspection of storage and process lines, to identify any leaks, damage or corrosion.
    \item Carry out regular medical examinations for plant personnel to identify any health issues related to toxicological effects of chemicals on-site.
\item Toxic materials will be stored within an bund, to prevent exposure in case of leakage.
\end{itemize}
