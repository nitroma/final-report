\section{Plant layout}

\subsection{Location}

Nitromaâ€™s plant site will be located in Nanjing Chemical Industry Park (NCIP), China. One of the main advantages of the NCIP is the shared utilises (including power, steam, water and recycling facilities), which are available to facilities in the area \cite{independent_commodity_intelligence_services_china_2007}. The NCIP lies on the northern banks of the Yangtze River, situated approximately 30km from the city centre, a significant distance between the sites and the residential areas \cite{zeng_divergent_2011}.

The initial design of the plant layout began with the block layout methodology, providing a simple visualisation of various areas which are segregated according to associated risks and requirements \cite{center_for_chemical_process_safety_site_2010}. 


















The site will be spilt into three sections. The first section will the production site and control room. The second site will hold storage units for raw material storage and the waste, as well as the waste treatment site. The third site will be where the administrative building, car park and an onsite fire station are located. 

\subsection{Production site}

The production site of the plant will consist of 5 major sections; 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Toluene nitration
    \item 2-Nitrotoluene reduction 
    \item 4-Nitrotoluene oxidation 
    \item 4-Nitrobenzoic acid reduction 
    \item 4-Nitrobenzaldehyde reduction 
\end{itemize}

Each of the reactors will be spaced out to reduce potential domino effect that may occur, should thermal runaway occur.
