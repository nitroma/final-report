\subsection{Location}

Nitromaâ€™s plant site will be located in Nanjing Chemical Industry Park (NCIP), China. One of the main advantages of the NCIP is the shared utilises (including power, steam, water and recycling facilities), which are available to facilities in the area \cite{independent_commodity_intelligence_services_china_2007}. The NCIP lies on the northern banks of the Yangtze River, situated approximately 30km from the city centre, a significant distance between the sites and the residential areas \cite{zeng_divergent_2011}.
