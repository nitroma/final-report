\section{Hazard and operability study (HAZOP) }
 
A HAZOP was carried out on the section of the plant in which o-toluidine is produced. By conducting a HAZOP, Nitroma can systematically identify and evaluate the risks and consequences associated with any deviations or faults that may occur during steady state operation. Through this, appropriate measures will be taken to reduce the occurrence of these consequences and thus prevent personnel injury and plant damage. The section was spilt into two nodes, with design intent of each node stated in \cref{tab:nodes}. The first node is focused on the reaction side, consisting of the reactant feeds, the trickle bed reactor, (R201), two pumps (P202a, P202b), two heaters (H201, H202) and two fans (F201a, F201b). The second node, which focuses on the separation and purification, starts at the reactor outlet from FCV-203, with the major equipment being the packed distillation column (S201), a condenser (H203), a reflux drum (S204) and a kettle reboiler (H204).

    \rtext{Design Intent} & Methanol and o-nitrotoluene feed (from mixer M201) passes through pump P201a/P201b and heat exchanger H202 (to reach the required reaction temperature \SI{333}{\K}) before entering R201. Hydrogen is transferred from the storage tank, passing through a fan F201a/F201b and heat exchanger H201 before entering R201. Reduction of o-nitrotoluene in R201 occurs at \SI{333}{\K}, \SI{5}{\atm}. Hydrogen gas is recycled back into R201, whilst o-toluidine, by-products and unreacted substances are transferred for separation. & The outlet stream of R201 is transferred to the distillation column, S201 via V201 (which reduces the pressure of the stream from \SIrange{5}{1}{\atm}). Within S201, o-toluidine (bottoms stream) separated from unreacted o-nitrotoluene, by-products and unreacted substances, is sent to reboiler, H204. The top, vapour stream (by-products and unreacted substances), is transferred from S201 to H203 for partial condensation. Following liquidation, the stream is sent to a flash drum, S204, to separate non-condensable and condensable compounds. \\ \bottomrule

Following the review of the HAZOP study, several of the recommendations suggested were implemented to the design, to allow further control of some of the system deviations and associated  consequences identified.
