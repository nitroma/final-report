\section{Hazard and operability study (HAZOP) }
 
A HAZOP was carried out on the identified on the section of the plant in which o-toluidine is produced. By conducting a HAZOP, Nitroma can systematically identify and evaluate the risks and consequences associated to any deviations or faults that may occur during steady state operation. Through this, appropriate measures will be taken to reduce the occurrence of these consequences and thus prevent personnel injury and plant damage. The section was spilt into two nodes.
