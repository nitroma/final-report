\section{Hazard and operability study (HAZOP) }
 
A HAZOP was carried out on the identified on the section of the plant in which o-toluidine is produced. By conducting a HAZOP, Nitroma can systematically identify and evaluate the risks and consequences associated to any deviations or faults that may occur during steady state operation. Through this, appropriate measures will be taken to reduce the occurrence of these consequences and thus prevent personnel injury and plant damage. The section was spilt into two nodes, with design intent of each stated in Table \ref{tab:nodes}. The first node is focused on the reaction side, consisting of the reactant feeds, the trickle bed reactor, (R201), two pumps (P202a, P202b), two heaters (H201, H202) and two fans (F201a, F201b). The second node, which focuses on the separation and purification, starts at the reactor outlet from FCV-203, with the major equipment being the packed distillation column (S203), a condenser (H203), a reflux drum (S204) and a reboiler (H204).
