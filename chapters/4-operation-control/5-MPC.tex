\section{Opportunities for advanced control}

\subsection{Model Predictive Control}
Model Predictive control (MPC) is an advanced control technique that can cope with complex multivariate control problems. It functions by taking in measurements of manipulated variables and disturbances from the plant and then calculates values for the controlled variables.
