\section{Conclusion and outlook}
A plant-wide approach was adopted in the design of Nitroma's control system so as to minimise disturbance propagation through different process units. A plant-wide survey identified important control structures to ensure safe and steady operation of Nitroma's plant. Pump P throughput manipulator was Throughput control wacontrolled variables and proposed potential control structures.
