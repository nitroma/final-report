\section{Plant-wide control}

\subsection{Plant-wide control philosophy and survey table}%0.25 page

Instead of design control systems for individual units, Nitroma aims at developing an effective plant-wide control structure for the entire chemical plant following a general heuristic procedure proposed by \textcite{}. A plant-wide control approach offers many advantages including the efficient mitigation of disturbance propagation introduced by the presence of multiple recycle loops in the process. Another benefit from this approach is that the likelihood of conflicts between control loops is reduced, resulting in very highly unlikely  oscillatory behaviour. 

Control objective and the consequences associated with poor control were identified during a plant-wide control survey conducted on all major process units. For each potential control loop, a controlled variable and a manipulated variable were identified. The type of sensor and actuator was then selected. All possible disturbances affecting the controlled variable were then listed out. Finally the survey addressed major maintenance issues for each of the process units and proposed solutions to mitigate those issues. The plant wide survey can be found in the Supporting Documentation \Cref{sec:PWS}.

-	Composition analysis is long  use T for inferential control  need good calibration curves  + strong impact of impurities  experimental + use density / viscosity measurements as proxi %(https://aavos.eu/product/liquid-density-sensor-lds/#:~:text=The%20Micro%20Liquid%20Density%20Sensor,addition%20to%20density%20and%20temperature.&text=Currently%20the%20Micro%20Sensors%20can%20measure%20density%20for%20liquid%20materials%20only )
-	Hot spot temperature measure in reactor R101 
o	correlations of wall temperature to inner temperature + cooling water outlet temperature 
-	Continuous system  less difficult control dynamics than batch 
-	Dynamic modelling of control loop interactions
o	Still need to have dynamic modelling of subsection to be able to design better control loops, transfer functions etc
