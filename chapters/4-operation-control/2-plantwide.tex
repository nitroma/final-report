\section{Plant-wide control}

\subsection{Plant-wide control philosophy and survey table}%0.25 page

Instead of design control systems for individual units, Nitroma aims at developing an effective plant-wide control structure for the entire chemical plant following a general heuristic procedure proposed by \textcite{}. A plant-wide control approach offers many advantages including the efficient mitigation of disturbance propagation introduced by the presence of multiple recycle loops in the process. Another benefit from this approach is that the likelihood of conflicts between control loops is reduced, resulting in very highly unlikely  oscillatory behaviour. 

Control objective and the consequences associated with poor control were identified during a plant-wide control survey conducted on all major process units. For each potential control loop, a controlled variable and a manipulated variable were identified. The type of sensor and actuator was then selected. All possible disturbances affecting the controlled variable were then listed out. Finally the survey addressed major maintenance issues for each of the process units and proposed solutions to mitigate those issues. The plant wide survey can be found in the Supporting Documentation \Cref{sec:PWS}.

\subsubsection{Difficult measurements and dynamics} %0.75 page
During the plant-wide control survey, difficult measurements were identified and solutions were proposed to overcome the control challenges. Firstly, composition analysis is essential to ensure the final products met their quality specification. However composition analysis is a rather long measurement which means that there can be a long time delay between the apparition of a problem, its identification by the composition transmitter and its resolution via the control loops in place. Where possible inferential control can be implemented to reduce the time delay. For instance, the top and bottom composition of distillation column outlet streams can be controlled with temperature []. However for inferential control to be effective, robust calibration curves between the measured variable and the controlled variable must exist. Moreover the presence of impurities can significantly impact the correlation between the two process variables, ultimately leading to off-specification products. It is recommended to perform thorough experiments to obtain adequate calibration curves to be used in inferential control. In addition to inferential control with temperature, the composition can be inferred from density and viscosity measurements []. Multiplying the number of proxi measured variable should increase the accuracy of the inferential control of composition.

Furthermore, the robust control of temperature in the reactors is one of Nitroma's major concerns since all reactions are highly exothermic and could lead to thermal runaways. More specifically, in the nitration reactor R101, a hot spot can form at the centre of the catalyst bed in the shell-and-tube heat exchanger reactor, which means it can not be directly measured with temperature transmitters placed at the walls. It is suggested to conduct experiments and modelling work to develop correlations between the reactor wall temperature and the inner temperature. Additionally, the monitoring of cooling water outlet temperature can infer of the presence of a significant increase in temperature in the reactor.

Difficult dynamics can also be encountered while conducting a plant-wide control structure. Since Nitroma's process is continuous, it is expected that less difficult control dynamics will be found as opposed to a batch process. Nonetheless, it is necessary to have dynamic modelling of plant to be able to design better control loops and transfer functions.


\subsubsection{Process bottleneck} % 0.25 page

The nitration reactor R101 is Nitroma's process bottleneck since it produces the precursors for all three products made. As the first major unit in the process, any issue encountered in its operation could cascade through the whole plant. The operation conditions of this reactor indeed determine the proportions of the three products, as well as the final quantity and purity which can be obtained. 	Safety functions were installed to closely monitor and control operational parameters (temperature, pressure, flow and composition). To avoid the propagation of quality disturbances to downstream units, additional buffer tanks are installed. In addition to regular maintenance and inspection of the equipment for fouling and early catalyst deactivation, a back-up cooling system is implemented to reduce as much as reasonably feasible the risk of thermal runaway.

\subsubsection{Feed quality}
The quality of the toluene, nitric acid, formic acid, hydrogen air and methanol used in the process can significantly affect the good operation of the system. In addition to lowering the final product quality, impurities present in the feeds can decrease catalyst activity in the reactors, thus resulting in lower production and off-specification products. Mitigating strategies include the installation of feed composition analysers and a procedure to ensure storage tanks are correctly sealed. It is also recommended to use air s
