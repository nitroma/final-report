Despite the safety improvements brought by process intensification and continuous operation, any process involving nitration and reduction under pressure inherently presents safety risks due to the explosive nature of the chemicals. Additional complexities arise from the numerous recycle streams, highly exothermic reactors and the multipurpose nature of Nitroma's process. To guarantee operational safety and ensure production and quality targets are constantly met, tight operational controls are required.  

To this end, a plant-wide control approach has been taken to design a control system capable of minimising disturbance propagation through the plant.

As no industrial level design has been previously studied, it is key to control the inherent dangers present across the plant.

%To enable this, the general control philosophy, key controls and their difficulties have been described. A plant-wide survey was carried out for the major process units involved in each of the sections covering the manipulated and controlled variable pairs to maintain safe and consistent operation. To narrow the focus of control, the reactor section of the plant was selected for detailed design of control loops and representation on a piping and instrumentation diagram.
