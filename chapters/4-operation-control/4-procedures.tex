\section{Start-up and shut-down procedures for agreed plant section}
The start-up and shutdown procedures for the agreed plant section were elaborated based on the recommendations proposed by \textcite{}. The guiding principles are presented, followed by the detailed start-up and shut-down procedures. Calculations for the time allocated to various steps can be found in \Cref{app:samplecal}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Step 4: To prepare the cooling water system, valves xx and xx have to be opened. It is assumed that equipment outside this section pump the cooling water to the plant.
    \item Step 5: The steam system is started by opening valves xx.
    \item Step 6: To start the fan F201 and the electric heaters H201 and H203, xx
    \item Step 7: To purge the units with nitrogen, valves xx
    \item Step 8: 
    \item Step 10: Valves xx are opened to begin the flow of hydrogen to the plant.
    \item Step 11: The hydrogen recycle purge is open via valve xx
