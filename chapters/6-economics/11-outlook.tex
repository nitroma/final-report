\section{Outlook}
Nitroma has laid out a series of next steps to launch its business in Nanjing, China. These include:
Discussions with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce to officially register Nitroma 
Negotiations with commercial banks and foreign private equity investors to raise $22.6m in funding. The Bank of China’s 13.7% increase in business loans in 2020 has made it an attractive option. 
Negotiations with raw material suppliers regarding price and quantities of supplies. Yangzi Sinopec Petrochemical, China’s largest manufacturer of toluene, has been identified as the first point of contact.
Contact manufacturers for exact quotes on equipment prices.
Explore government subsidies available to Nitroma that could alleviate the company’s initial investment.
