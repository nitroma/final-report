\section{Outlook}
Nitroma has laid out a series of steps to launch its business in Nanjing, China. These include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Discussions with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce to officially register Nitroma.
    \item Negotiations with commercial banks and foreign private equity investors to raise \$22.6m in funding. The Bank of China’s 13.7\% increase in business loans in 2020 has made it an attractive option \cite{kimathi_china_2020}.
    \item Negotiations with raw material suppliers regarding price and quantities of supplies. Yangzi Sinopec Petrochemical, China’s largest manufacturer of toluene, has been identified as the first point of contact \cite{sinopec_group_sinopec_2014}.
    \item Contact with manufacturers for exact quotes on equipment prices.
    \item Exploration of government subsidies available to Nitroma that could alleviate the company’s initial investment. The Jiangsu Industrial Enterprise Technology Upgrading Project Compensation scheme has been identified as a viable option \cite{net}.
    \item Development of a detailed capacity expansion plan.
\end{itemize}
