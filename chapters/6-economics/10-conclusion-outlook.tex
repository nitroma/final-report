\section{Conclusion and outlook}
Nitroma aims to capture a 1.4%, 1.9% and 0.2% share of the PABA, PABH and OTOL markets respectively. To combat the highly competitive speciality chemicals environment in China, Nitroma will leverage the financial benefit of employing a novel continuous nitration process to undercut the average market price of its competitorsâ€™ products by 12.5%. Nitroma also seeks the reward of fulfilling unmet demand as many of its competitors are removed from the market due to unsafe practices. Here, Nitroma promises its buyers a stable product supply due its inherently safer continuous nitration process. To retain a stable market position over its lifetime, Nitroma will expand its operating capacity by 10 days per year every 5 year until decommissioning in 2043
