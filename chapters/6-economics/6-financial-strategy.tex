\section{Financial strategy}
\subsection{Corporate tax rate}
The standard corporate income tax rate in China is 25\% (XX). However, the tax rate can be reduced to 15\% for qualified foreign-invested enterprises which are listed in the catalogue of industries encouraged by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. Nitroma falls into the encouraged chemical raw material and products manufacturing industry, and so, a corporate tax rate of 15\% is used for economic analysis (XX). To promote on-site safety, the Chinese government also issues a 10\% subsidy on the purchase of waste disposal equipment which Nitroma will credit against tax payable annually (XX).
