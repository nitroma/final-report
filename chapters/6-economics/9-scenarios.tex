Four scenarios were analysed to understand the combined effect of the parameters tested in Section \ref{sec:sensitivities-kpis}. Table \ref{tab:scenario_analysis} summarises the fluctuations made in each scenario. The best- and worst-case scenarios were based off the most extreme variations of each parameter in the sensitivity analysis. 

One scenario was related to a situation where COVID-19 resurfaced in Nanjing, China, and restriction measures were in place till 2026. The number of operational days per year was expected to drop by \SI{40}{\percent} based on the lockdown period during the initial outbreak of coronavirus in 2020 (bbc 20). A \SI{40}{\percent} decrease in the cost of raw materials was also modelled into the scenario, based on the fall in toluene prices between January and April 2020 (sunsirs 21). Similarly, a \SI{40}{\percent} decrease in interest rate was applied, based off the drop in the average Chinese interest rate between January and April 2020 (statista 21). A 3-year delay in production was also anticipated due to reduced labour availability. The price of Nitroma’s products was not expected to change considerably, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:market-analysis}. It should be noted that the coronavirus conditions were only applied until 2026, after which the base case conditions were restored in the scenario test.

Figure \ref{DCF_scenario} shows Nitroma’s discounted cash flows till 2043 for each tested scenario. Across all the tested scenarios, the minimum ending cash balance was \$23.1 million and the longest payback period was 10.3 years. These results show the robustness of this project and should enhance the confidence of the shareholders.
